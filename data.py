Her eyes will be fully formed around week 22, but she still won\u2019t have any pigmentation (color) in her iris until a bit later on, and it may not be her true color until at least nine months after birth, as the iris needs sunlight to stimulate melanin production.</p><br><p>Melanin is responsible for coloring the hair and eyes, and the more melanin there is, the darker the color. Blue eyes have the least amount of melanin, followed by green, then hazel, and then brown. Most Caucasian babies will have blue or steel-colored eyes following delivery, as there is not yet enough melanin built up to turn her eyes their true shade, while babies of African or Asian descent may have a darker eye color to begin with.</p>",

She will continue to develop her brain cells throughout pregnancy and expand her functionality, eventually being capable of regulating body temperature, controlling her heartbeat, and all other involuntary human processes.</p><br><p>Her\u2019s skull remains very soft throughout gestation so that her brain has plenty of room to grow.</p><br><h3>A tight squeeze</h3><br><p>The bones in a growing baby's head are not yet fused, so as to make for an easier delivery. You'll also probably notice two 'soft spots' after birth at the front and back of the head, known as fontanelles. When she passes headfirst through the birth canal, her soft skull may get cramped, and mold to be slightly lopsided when she\u2019s born.</p><br><p>Oftentimes, babies who rest their head at the same angle too frequently may also notice some asymmetrical flattening. Swelling of the skin and soft tissues is another common contributor to this 'coneheadedness'.</p><br><h3>Evening out</h3><br><p>Babies\u2019 skulls don\u2019t generally fuse until about a year after birth, so even if it\u2019s a little lopsided early on, there\u2019s plenty of time for it to even back out. In fact, most babies\u2019 skulls will even out on their own as they get older, and more able to support their heads and necks.</p><br><p>Babies who lie on their backs for most of the day may be at a heightened risk for a lopsided head, so try to get Baby on her belly for a little bit of supervised tummy time each day to vary the head\u2019s point of contact with the ground.</p><br><p>If the lopsidedness does not go away by about six months after she is born, healthcare providers may recommend using a helmet to help apply a bit of pressure to the head and get it all nice and symmetrical, but most babies\u2019 skulls will fix themselves naturally.</p>",

She will eventually lose all of this pseudo-hair before, or shortly after delivery.</p><br><h3>Why does Baby grow lanugo?</h3><br><p>In early gestation, Baby doesn\u2019t have enough fat to regulate her own body temperature. As a result, lanugo will begin to grow as a light coating over most of her body to help keep her warm.</p><br><h3>When does lanugo fall off?</h3><br><p>Lanugo generally sloughs off deeper into pregnancy as Baby gains more of an ability to control her body temperature, with a more highly functioning nervous system, and increased accumulation of fat beneath her super-soft skin. Most babies lose their lanugo in the eighth or ninth month of pregnancy, though some can be born with remnants of the fine coating still on their body. However, nearly all lanugo will be shed by three or four months after birth.</p><br><p>And a disgusting fun fact: babies eat the lanugo that they shed while in the womb, and it builds up within them to form the substance that makes up their first poop, known as meconium.</p><br><h3>What's next for Baby's hair?</h3><br><p>After Baby sheds and eats her lanugo, she will develop vellus hair on the same areas that the lanugo coated previously. The vellus hair will continue to help Baby regulate temperature as she transitions into the outside world until her beautiful adult (terminal) hair grows in.</p>",

In fact, one study conducted by a professor at the University of Washington suggests that babies might already be listening and remembering during the late stages of pregnancy.</p><br><p>Talking to Baby may also help stir up the learning juices, and make it easier for her to learn how to talk.</p><br><h3>Fun things to say to Baby</h3><br><p>If you\u2019re having trouble getting started talking to Baby, here are some ideas for things you can talk about:</p><br><ul><li>Talk to her like she is already born.

    "body": "<p>Fetal size and growth is important all through pregnancy, but it\u2019s not always important for the same reason.</p><br><p>In the first trimester of pregnancy, fetal length is compared to your last period date to estimate how long the baby has been developing, and determine an estimated due date. As the pregnancy progresses, calculations of fetal size are used to assess how well a child is growing. Healthcare providers use these measurements to make sure that the fetus is developing as she should, and that there are no warning signs related to growth, as both too-small and too-large babies can be at risk for health problems.</p><br><p>Calculations of fetal size during later pregnancy are also compared against data about the average size for fetuses of that age. This way of looking at a baby\u2019s age compared to her size will continue as she grows from fetus to infant, and all the way into toddlerhood, typically as the percentile she is in.</p><br><p>Percentiles can be useful for tracking to make sure a fetus\u2019s, a baby\u2019s, (and, later, child\u2019s) growth is on-track and steady as she gets older.</p><br><h3>Early fetal measurements</h3><br><p>In the first trimester, doctors measure fetal length from crown to rump, or from the top of a baby\u2019s head to the bottom of her bottom. Crown to rump measurements are made using an ultrasound, and are only used early on in pregnancy (until about 14 weeks), while the fetus is still in more of a curled position.</p><br><h3>Later fetal measurements</h3><br><p>After 20 weeks of pregnancy, fetal growth is typically monitored using fundal height, or the distance from the pubic bone to the top of the uterus, essentially measuring the height of the uterus. After 20 weeks, fundal height in centimeters generally lines up roughly with gestational age, so that at 20 weeks, fundal height is generally about 20 cm. Fundal height is only a rough measurement of fetal size, but it\u2019s a simple, noninvasive way of getting a sense of fetal size and growth.</p><br><p>Most healthcare providers use fundal height as a regular way of getting a rough sense of fetal growth, although some don\u2019t find it as useful, since it can be less accurate for pregnancies of people who are obese, people who have a history of fibroids, or who are carrying twins or multiples. It can also be less accurate in pregnancies where there\u2019s extra fluid in the uterus (called polyhydramnios pregnancies), or where there\u2019s an especially large baby (called a macrosomia).</p><br><p>A more accurate, but also more involved, way of measuring fetal size after 14 weeks is by taking measurements using an ultrasound. After 14 weeks, her growth is estimated using measurements of other, newly-developed body parts. This type of measurement gives a more accurate sense of size. Using an ultrasound to measure the diameter, or distance across, and circumference, or distance around, the head, the circumference of the abdomen, and the length of the femur (thigh bone) gives doctors the ability to estimate fetal size more accurately in the later part of pregnancy.</p><br><p>Generally, routine ultrasounds to measure fetal size in low-risk pregnancies aren\u2019t considered clinically useful, and are only used when a healthcare provider is concerned about the baby\u2019s growth.</p>",

Your body is smart enough to feed Baby on its own while she is growing in your womb, but it\u2019s a whole different story once she is born. Whether you breastfeed naturally, pump your breast milk, or use formula, there is a perfect way for every mom to feed her baby.</p><br><h3>Breastfeeding</h3><br><p>Whether they're bigger, sore, itchy, leaky, or just different, breasts change over the course of pregnancy as the body\u2019s natural way of preparing to produce milk and breastfeed Baby. When you\u2019re pregnant, your breasts start to produce a thick yellowish substance known as colostrum that will make up Baby\u2019s first few meals. Colostrum helps build up her immune system, and is very rich in nutrients. Colostrum will surrender to regular breast milk within a week of Baby's birth. This mature breast milk contains the right contents of water, protein, fat, and lactose to help her grow big and strong, and can also help protect her against many illnesses and woes, including:</p><br><ul><li>Asthmas</li><br><li>Diarrhea</li><br><li>Ear infections</li><br><p>Breastfeeding may also help prevent against long-term disorders, like diabetes, Crohn\u2019s, and obesity, as well as Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS), and will continue to strengthen Baby\u2019s immune system.</p><br><p>The American Academy of Pediatrics recommends breastfeeding for at least one year, but there is no set timetable for when moms should stop - it all depends on how comfortable you and she are with the arrangement. However, breastfeeding naturally isn\u2019t the best fit for all women and babies whether due to unavailability, discomfort, or any other reason. Luckily, there are other ways to get Baby the nutrients she craves during her first few years.</p><br><h3>Breast pumps</h3><br><p>Most moms know that breast milk is the best food for Baby to grow and stay healthy, but natural breastfeeding is simply not an option for everybody. Those who still want their baby to drink their breast milk, but do not wish to breastfeed or are having difficulty doing so, can utilize breast pumps to store their own nutrient-rich milk, and feed it to baby through a bottle. This is a great way for working moms to get baby the same super-healthy milk in an easier, more convenient way.</p><br><p>For some women though, neither breastfeeding nor breast pumping is a viable option for feeding baby. Although some benefits of breast milk can not be replicated, there are many baby formulas that baby can take to grow happily and healthily.</p><br><h3>Formulas</h3><br><p>For some women, both breastfeeding and breast pumping are simply not options. Luckily, scientists have developed a number of baby formulas that contain high quantities of the nutrients that Baby needs to grow big and strong, like DHA, Vitamin D, calcium and more. Most formulas come as either a powder, or liquid concentrate, which then need to be mixed with water before becoming baby\u2019s 5-star entree. Some moms will choose to use formula from the day baby is born, while others will make the switch after a few months or years. Some babies might even switch right from breastfeeding to steak dinners - you never know!</p>",

When Baby is old enough, place her on her belly to prompt her to move around.</li></ul><br><h3>The bottom line</h3><br><p>The research is slim on precisely which techniques are the most effective for educating your little genius, so it doesn\u2019t hurt to experiment!

    "body": "<p>Ah, the due date. That day, month, and year is going to etch itself deep into your mind as you traverse the nine months until delivery, but how do you figure out when it is? Babies on average need about 38 weeks in the womb from the time of conception, but you won\u2019t really know the exact date when that magic happened. So healthcare providers have several different methods that they can use to determine when Baby is due.</p><br><h3>Last menstrual period (LMP)</h3><br><p>Most healthcare providers will use this method because the vast majority of moms-to-be don\u2019t know exactly when they conceived. When calculating using this method, healthcare providers count 40 weeks forward from the first day of your last menstrual period, a figure that includes the 38 weeks of gestation plus an assumed 2 week span between your LMP, and ovulation. While this method works well for women who have 28-day menstrual cycles with ovulation squarely in the middle (day 14 or 15), most do not, so your healthcare provider may have to re-adjust your due date further down along line.</p><br><h3>Date of conception</h3><br><p>If you know the exact date of conception, you can simply add 38 weeks, and you\u2019ve got your due date. This should make calculating a due date easy, right? Well, it's not that simple. But why? It's because the exact date of conception is really hard to know. Conception is when sperm meets egg. And, remember, intercourse can lead to pregnancy any time in the five days leading up to ovulation, which is when an egg is released from an ovary. So even if you only had sex once during a cycle\u2019s fertile window and conceived, the actual fertilization may have taken place as many as five days after that intercourse. In other words, after you have sex, sperm might hang around for a few days before an egg arrives and conception actually takes place. Since you can't get a handy dandy text notification or receive a status update to know exactly when - hooray! - sperm and egg have finally met, it's hard to have more than an estimate of when conception takes place. But a due date is just an estimate anyway.</p><br><h3>Ultrasound</h3><br><p>Your healthcare provider will monitor Baby\u2019s size and development throughout your pregnancy, and will adjust your due date if he or she has any reason to (i.e Baby is smaller than a normal fetus is at an 8-week ultrasound). Because the normal variance in size between babies increases as pregnancy progresses, earlier ultrasounds are generally regarded as more accurate in determining due date.</p><br><h3>Put it in perspective</h3><br><p>Just remember - your due date is an estimate, not an exact calculation. In fact, 95% of babies aren\u2019t born on their due dates. Due dates are simply there to help you prepare for Baby on a timetable, and for your healthcare provider to monitor Baby\u2019s size and health against the averages.</p>",

This first felt movement is known as the \u201cquickening\u201d.</p><br><h3>Counting kicks</h3><br><p>Counting Baby\u2019s kicks can double as a fun game, as well as a way to keep an eye out to make sure everything is okay.</p><br><p>Women with high-risk pregnancies will probably be advised by their healthcare provider to keep track of her kicks to watch over her health - if you fall into this category, your healthcare provider will surely brief you on how to go about doing so.</p><br><p>Even women with normal pregnancies may be advised, or wish to keep track of Baby\u2019s kicks to monitor development, usually after 28 weeks or so. ACOG recommends that women find a comfortable position (lying on the left side works well), and wait until they feel 10 kicks, flutters, or other baby movements (this should take less than 2 hours) - if the kicks aren\u2019t coming, it may just be that Baby has taken to sleep, so trying again in a few hours may help. If it takes longer than 2 hours to record the 10 movements again, it's recommended that you call your provider.</p><br><h3>When to call your healthcare provider</h3><br><p>Pregnant moms should call their healthcare provider about Baby\u2019s inactivity if they notice any of the following:</p><br><ul><li>Drastic change in frequency of her\u2019s movements over the course of a day</li><br><li>Failure to detect 10 kicks in 2 hours multiple times in a given day</li><br><li>Any abnormal movement you may suspect, just in case</li></ul><br><h3>The bottom line</h3><br><p>Counting Baby\u2019s kicks is a great way to monitor her health, but it\u2019s important to remember that just as you do, Baby needs sleep! In fact, babies in the womb tend to sleep even more than grown-ups, and are coaxed to sleep by your daily movements, so she may be asleep when you\u2019re trying to feel for kicks.

Although developments in ultrasound technology have made sex detection far more accurate and accessible in the past fifty years, some women still swear by age-old tricks and heuristics for determining baby\u2019s sex, whether scientifically-verified, or not.</p><br><h3>Other methods of predicting sex</h3><br><ul><li><h3>Dry hands:</h3>Legends say that if you notice dry hands during pregnancy, you\u2019ll be having a girl. However, other legends say that if you notice dry hands, it means you\u2019re having a boy! Our take? Don\u2019t put your eggs in the dry hands basket.</li><li><h3>Stealing your beauty:</h3>Some stories say that if you notice acne and other skin blemishes while you\u2019re pregnant, it\u2019s a girl! Our take? It\u2019s probably just hormones, not a jealous baby girl.</li><li><h3>Carrying low:</h3>Lots of people believe that if you\u2019re carrying low, it means you\u2019re having a boy, and if you\u2019re carrying high, you\u2019ve got a girl. Our take? Don\u2019t go ahead and buy baby\u2019s monogrammed bathrobe just yet.</li><li><h3>The wedding ring:</h3>Some women swear that tying their wedding rings to a string, and then hanging it over their belly can predict boy or girl - if the ring swings in a circle, you\u2019ll be having a baby boy, and if it goes back and forth then you\u2019ve got a gorgeous girl on the way! Our take? It could be a fun game, but don\u2019t bet on its accuracy.</li><li><h3>Chinese sex chart:</h3>Allegedly discovered in an ancient royal tomb, the Chinese Sex Chart purports to predict baby\u2019s sex based on your age and the month of conception and claims to be 90% accurate. Our take? Show us the evidence, then we\u2019ll believe you.</li></ul><br><h3>The bottom line</h3><br><p>Although alternative forms of sex prediction exist besides ultrasounds, the accuracy of each method is unproven, so we recommend relying on the ultrasound, or a non-invasive prenatal blood test, if you\u2019re going to be investing heavily in pink or blue before baby is born.</p>",

    "body": "<p>All babies are different - they like different types of songs, and different types of toys, but when it comes to nipples, now that's something every baby can agree on. Pacifiers are rubber nipples used to keep babies comfortable when it's not feeding time, and can be a very valuable resource for parents.</p><br><h3>Advantages of using a pacifier</h3><br><p>Babies don't tend to be the most reasonable of people, and can get a bit antsy when they don't get what they want, which is quite often your breasts. Giving Baby a pacifier can be an excellent way to keep her comfortable in between feedings, as suckling is among her favorite hobbies.</p><br><p>In addition, some studies show that infants who use pacifiers at sleep time have a lessened risk of Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS) than babies who don't use them, although there is no evidence to support why this is so.</p><br><p>You should also note that pacifiers come in many different shapes, and a baby may gravitate towards one and not the other, so you shouldn't give up if Baby isn't a huge fan of the first few.</p><br><h3>Are there any concerns with using pacifiers?</h3><br><p>Although pacifiers can do quite a bit for a baby's mood, there are also some disadvantages to using a pacifier. Babies who use pacifiers are significantly more likely to develop ear infections, although the reason for this is unclear. Pacifiers can sometimes cause orthodontic problems, so you may want to look into specially-designed orthodontic pacifiers.</p><br><p>Parents are also often advised to wait until breasfeeding is established (usually a few weeks to a month after birth) to introduce a pacifier to their baby, as earlier introduction may result in feeding problems.</p><br><p>The last major concern with using a pacifier is the weaning process - most parents will want their child off of the pacifier by the time they are talking, but this can be quite the battle, particularly if your child's pacifier becomes an extension of herself.</p><br><h3>The bottom line</h3><br><p>While it's clear that you don't want Baby still suckling a pacifier in math class, most are able to wean off in a reasonable time, although it can be a difficult process. Giving her a pacifier can be an excellent way to help her stay comfortable and happy when she can't have her favorite thing - you!</p>",

    "body": "<p>Devised by Dr. Virginia Apgar in 1952, the Apgar score is a number from 1-10 that indicates how healthy a newborn is at birth, based on five categories; Appearance, Pulse rate, Grimace (reflex), Activity, and Respiratory effort. A score of 7 or above is considered normal, while 4 to 6 is low, and 3 or below is critically low. The test is most frequently done at one and five minutes after birth, but may be performed again if the score is below 7 at the one or five minute intervals. A low score may mean that the baby requires medical attention, but does not necessarily indicate long-term problems.</p><br><p>Each of the five categories of the Apgar test is graded from 0-2, with 0 the lowest and 2 the highest. The scores from each of the five categories are added together to come up with the overall Apgar score.</p><br><h3>'A'ppearance</h3><br><p>The 'Appearance' portion measures oxygen flow across the body - a baby who is not getting enough may have a blue tint. A score of '0' will be given to those who are blue in the body and extremities, while a '1' will be given to those who are blue just in the extremities. Babies whose bodies and extremities are totally pink and healthy will be given a '2'.</p><br><h3>'P'ulse rate</h3><br><p>The 'Pulse' section measures the heart rate to make sure that a newborn's heart is functioning as it should. Babies with absent pulse rates get a score of '0', while those whose pulse rates exist but are below 100 are given a '1', and those with a pulse of over 100 get a '2'.</p><br><h3>'G'rimance (reflex)</h3><br><p>This measures the baby's reflexes - how they respond to stimulation. A baby geting a '0' will not respond to stimulation. A baby who gets a '1' will make some slight reaction, and a baby getting a '2' will cry or pull away when stimulated.</p><br><h3>'A'ctivity</h3><br><p>The 'Activity' portion scores baby on how well they are moving around. A baby who displays little activity will get a '0'. A baby with a '1' will show some flexion, while a baby who gets a '2' will display flexed arms and legs, and resist extension.</p><br><h3>'R'espiratory effort</h3><p>This section measures the amount of effort a baby is able to put toward breathing. A baby who displays no signs of breathing will get a '0'. Weak or inconsistent gasping gets a '1', and a strong cry will get a '2'.</p><br><h3>What happens if the score is low?</h3><br><p>Oftentimes, a baby with a total score below '7' may be in need of some extra medical attention, but this is not always the case - your healthcare provider will be able to give you a clear assessment of your baby's health regardless of the Apgar score. The Apgar score is among the best-known neonatal tests in the United States, but it is not universal. Your healthcare provider may have a different rubric that they use to score Baby's health, even if you are in the US.</p>",

    "body": "<p>Breastfeeding can feel like a roller coaster of ups and downs, depending on how used to it you\u2019ve become. The good news: once you\u2019ve adapted, many women say that breastfeeding feels great.</p><br><p>However, breastfeeding can be pretty uncomfortable in the beginning. Your breasts will feel full, heavy, and swollen with the milk they\u2019re carrying. Breastfeeding relieves that feeling, but your nipples will likely hurt for about two to three weeks when Baby first starts latching on and sucking. They\u2019ll feel sore at best, but can get downright painful. Getting her to latch on correctly helps alleviate the pain, and after a few weeks, your body will toughen up and get used to breastfeeding.</p><br><p>Once that happens, many women love breastfeeding. It\u2019s often described as a feeling of relief, especially if your breasts are full. Some women say that breastfeeding feels like a tingling, warm feeling in the breast, especially at the moment of the milk let-down reflex that begins the flow. The sucking feels like a gentle tugging sensation. Pleasurable feelings are common too, especially if you\u2019ve enjoyed nipple stimulation in the past (so don\u2019t feel weird about that!). And in the early weeks after delivery, don\u2019t be surprised if breastfeeding triggers uterine cramps. They\u2019re helping your uterus return to its post-baby size.</p><br><p>Breastfeeding\u2019s good feelings are often emotional as well as physical. Many women report a relaxed, calm state, helping them bond with their babies. Others even say they experience euphoria, a breastfeeding high brought on by the release of the hormones oxytocin and prolactin that accompanies baby\u2019s sucking.</p><br><p>Of course, every woman is different, and some just aren\u2019t that into breastfeeding. If that\u2019s you, it\u2019s okay! You don\u2019t need to force it. If there's something specific about breastfeeding that doesn't work for you, it can be a good idea to talk to a healthcare provider or lactation consultant, and see if there's anything you can do to help make breastfeeding a better experience for you, but if it doesn't work out, there\u2019s always the pump or formula option.</p>",

  {
    "body": "<p>Think you know everything there is to know about breastfeeding? Think again! Even if you\u2019ve already learned a lot about lactation, you might be surprised by some of the details of just how nature's all-Baby-can-eat-buffet works. Some facts are fun, some are downright fantastic, and some might even seem a little weird. But if you\u2019re thinking of breastfeeding once your baby arrives, you\u2019ll want to be well aware of all that could be in store, including the potentially surprising and strange.</p><br><h3>You'll burn a ton of calories</h3><p>When you feed your baby, your body is working overtime! Experts estimate that it takes about 500 calories to make the 24 to 28 ounces of breast milk that the average mom makes each day. That\u2019s the caloric equivalent of a serious brownie (or if you\u2019re eating healthier, about 20 medium carrots). Burning anywhere between 200 and 500 extra calories each day for milk production is typical.</p><br><h3>Hearing a baby cry could make your breasts start to leak</h3><p>When your baby latches onto your breast, her sucking triggers release of the hormone oxytocin, which stimulates milk production. This release of breast milk, called the let-down reflex, usually happens after Baby has been sucking for about two minutes. Some women feel the let-down reflex as a tingling or a warmth. But other stimuli can trigger the production of oxytocin too, including emotional ones like looking at a picture of Baby, thinking of her, or hearing a recording of her. Sometimes hearing any baby cry, not just your own, can trigger your let-down reflex. Sometimes this can be awkward - or leaky - but it\u2019s just your body\u2019s way of knowing what to do when a baby needs milk!</p><br><h3>You might get cramps</h3><p>Not only does Baby\u2019s sucking causes the release of oxytocin so that your milk can flow freely, but oxytocin also creates uterine contractions. Some women don\u2019t really notice these cramps, and others might feel them kick in like clockwork while nursing in the early days after delivery. Although uncomfortable, these cramps (also called afterpains) are also helpful. When you're pregnant, your uterus - a super strong muscle - has to grow much larger to make room for Baby, and the contractions that cause cramps also help to squeeze your uterus back to its pre-birth size. </p><br><h3>Bigger breasts don\u2019t mean more milk production</h3><p>Though you might assume otherwise, milk glands are what matter when it comes to milk production, not breast size. The larger the breast size, the more fatty tissues that exists, but it doesn't chance the milk glands at all, so a woman with an A-cup can actually make the same amount of milk as a woman with a double D, she just has less fatty tissue compared to glandular tissue. Even if your bust is on the smaller side, you\u2019ll likely be able to make plenty of milk for Baby!</p><br><h3>Your nipples may get uncomfortable</h3><p>This isn't a fun fact, but it\u2019s the truth. While you might hope that breastfeeding will be nothing but smooth sailing, things can be somewhat painful for the first few weeks or even months. Getting Baby to latch onto your breast at all, let alone correctly, can take time, and those initial 8 to 12 feeding sessions a day with a newborn can leave your nipples feeling raw and sore. The discomfort can range from slight tenderness to cracked and bleeding skin.</p><br><p>Fortunately, most women find that their nipples do toughen up a bit in just a few weeks, and as Baby grows and her mouth gets bigger, you might find even more comfort, as she latches on more comfortably. In the meantime, you can use nipple salves or balms like lanolin, nipple shields, or warm or cool compresses to provide some relief. Even if those early days are a bit ouchy, it\u2019s important to get Baby to latch on correctly and have enough time feeding at your breast. </p><br><p>However, certain types of breast pain could be evidence of infection or other problems. And since every woman\u2019s experience with breastfeeding is different, do speak to your healthcare provider if you have any questions about what\u2019s normal in terms of discomfort and what might help you feel better.</p><br><h3>Your milk will change over time</h3><p>The nutritional composition of your milk will change over time to keep up with Baby's nutritional needs. The first few days after she is born, instead of what you might usually think of as milk, you'll actually produce a fluid called colostrum that is rich in protein and antibodies. It will help your baby\u2019s new digestive system function properly, pass along immunity, and help her gain weight. In just a few days, this colostrum will transition to mature milk, first thin and watery and then thicker and creamier. As you continue to feed your baby over the coming months, the composition of this milk will continue to change, providing just the nutrients that Baby needs at that particular time.</p><br><h3>Your milk comes from many holes, not just the obvious one</h3><p>If you had to guess the spot where breast milk comes out, you might guess that it\u2019s right in the center of the nipple. In reality, milk comes from many openings in the nipple. Called milk duct orifices, these tiny holes usually number from around four to twenty per breast. Babies who are correctly latched onto the breast will have their mouths covering the entire areola, not just the tip of the nipple, so they can drink the milk from these multiple holes without a problem and without too much mess.</p><br><h3>You can breastfeed with body modifications</h3><p>Many women with breast implants can still breastfeed successfully. Implant incisions made through the armpit or underneath the breast tend to interfere with breastfeeding the least, whereas incisions around the areola can potentially increase problems with feeding like reduced nipple sensitivity or blocked milk ducts. And implant placement below the pectoralis muscle usually leaves the milk glands intact for future feeding.</p><br><p>If your body mods include nipple piercings, the hole created as a result shouldn\u2019t interfere with feedings either. As mentioned above, breastmilk comes from many holes at once, so one extra hole won\u2019t cause a problem. Just make sure that you remove your nipple jewelry before breastfeeding. And keep in mind that newer piercings have an increased risk of infection, so they should be fully healed before you attempt breastfeeding.</p><br><h3>Your partner might sexualize it</h3><p>Although your breasts will take on a new role once they\u2019re responsible for being nutritional providers for Baby, the way your partner views your breasts might not change much. Chances are that your partner has a special fondness for your breasts, and seeing them - even with a baby attached to them - could still be a turn-on. </p><br><p>You\u2019ll have a lot more success with breastfeeding if your partner supports you, so make sure they respect and understand just how important it is that your breasts have this new job to do. Certainly, this doesn\u2019t mean your breasts can\u2019t still be a turn-on! Just make sure you can work with your partner to strike a balance that doesn\u2019t feel strange.</p><br><h3>You might get turned on</h3><p>Speaking of getting turned-on, arousal during breastfeeding can be a common, if confusing, side effect. The fact of the matter is that the nipple is an erogenous zone, and erogenous zones usually feel good when stimulated; this doesn\u2019t stop just because you\u2019ve had a baby. Rest assured knowing that even if it\u2019s taboo to talk about, this physical response is experienced by many women. And, most importantly, the physical arousal you feel is totally separate from how you feel emotionally towards your baby, so there\u2019s really no need to be weirded out.</p>",

    "body": "<p>That Baby is going to be a human isn\u2019t up for debate. She may be as cute as a kitten, but that\u2019s probably where the resemblance will stop. But whether she is going to be a person, when you\u2019re using the word to define a legal entity, well, that\u2019s a little bit more up to you.</p><br><p>In the U.S., a child\u2019s legal personhood is first established by her birth certificate. If her parents aren\u2019t married, a statement of paternity is generally thrown into the mix, depending on state laws and regulations.</p><br><p>After that, most families choose to apply for a Social Security number, which will then be used on identifying paperwork for school, jobs, home rentals or purchase, applying for a driver\u2019s license, and a lot of other things Baby is still just a little bit too young for, but will probably be interested in eventually.</p><br><h3>In the hospital</h3><p>Babies born in hospitals have it easy - the hospital certifies Baby\u2019s live birth, and her parents just have to fill out a little paperwork to get the ball rolling. Most parents pick their children\u2019s names while they\u2019re still in the hospital and filling out that first rush of paperwork, but you do have the option to wait and name your child later, which some families prefer to having to rush to choose a name.</p><br><p>Babies born in hospitals have it easy - the hospital certifies Baby\u2019s live birth, and her parents just have to fill out a little paperwork to get the ball rolling.

In some states, the father can\u2019t be confirmed in documentation unless he\u2019s physically present, while in others, the mother might be pushed to name a father even if she\u2019s reluctant, for legal reasons.</p><br><p>Establishing paternity is important even for completely amicable, cohabitating, unmarried parents, because it provides a legal framework in case of emergency, discussions of custody, or inheritance in the case of a parent\u2019s death.</p><br><p>Another part of this process is applying for a Social Security card. The hospital itself can\u2019t process this paperwork, and while many hospitals send the paperwork in for you, not all of them do, so it\u2019s worth checking. The hospital won\u2019t register your baby for a Social Security number without your consent, so there should be a box on this form that you check to give your approval. When the paperwork for Baby\u2019s SSN is submitted, her Social Security card should arrive in the mail in a couple of months. If you need the number sooner to claim Baby on your taxes, the hospital should have information on what you\u2019ll need to bring with you to the Social Security office.</p><br><h3>For home births</h3><p>Depending on where you live, you may actually have a bit of leeway for when to register Baby\u2019s birth, if you delivered at home. In Illinois, as long as you register her birth within her first year, you don\u2019t even need to file a Delayed Registration Of Birth form. However, Texas requires that babies born at home be registered with the state within 5 days of birth. Registration of birth documents come from the county clerk\u2019s office, and should be signed by the mother, any midwife or other person who was there at the time of the birth, as well as the doctor, if any, who checked out mother and baby after delivery.</p><br><p>At this time, unmarried parents are encouraged to establish paternity, and once a record of birth has been established, parents can apply for a Social Security card for their children. It\u2019s helpful to have both parents\u2019 SSNs on hand for this process as well, and any other proof of your child\u2019s citizenship, age, and identity.</p><br><h3>Do I have to?</h3><p>Registering a baby\u2019s birth is required in the U.S., though the time-frame for when it\u2019s required by varies from state to state. On the other hand, you are not required to get your child a Social Security number. However, an SSN is needed to claim many benefits and services, especially health insurance, and is used to claim your child as an exemption on your taxes.</p><br><h3>Outside of the U.S.</h3><p>Countries outside of the U.S. each have their own deadline for how soon after delivery a baby's birth needs to be registered, and different countries use systems besides the Social Security system for alternate identification. Some countries have a very specific time by which babies need to have names, while others leave naming discretion until parents get sick of trying out nicknames. If you live outside the U.S, you should look up the rules and regulations in your country.</p>",

    "body": "<p>Not too long ago, cloth diapers were just rectangles of fabric, but the options that are available today are a lot more advanced and easier to use. No matter what your needs are for Baby's diapers, you'll likely be pleasantly surprised by the selection of cloth diapers available today. Cloth diapers come in a few styles, which vary by cost, absorbency, and shape.</p><br><h3>Flat and prefod diapers</h3><p>These are the 'classic' cloth diaper that your great-grandmother may have used when your grandmother was a baby. Flats are plain squares of cloth, while prefolds are rectangular pieces of cloth that have a more absorbent section in the middle.</p><ul><li><h3>Pros:</h3>These are the most affordable type of cloth diaper. They can also be used as great burp cloths or cleaning rags.</li><li><h3>Cons:</h3>They require a waterproof diaper cover. You'll also have to fold them and pin them in place using diaper pins or clasps. </li></ul><br><h3>Fitted diapers</h3><p>Like disposable diapers, fitteds are shaped like an hourglass and fit snugly to a baby's body.</p><ul><li><h3>Pros:</h3>Very breathable and absorbent. Fitteds come with velcro snaps or snap-closures, so they don't require folding or pinning. They come in a variety of colors, patterns, and sizes, and are very adjustable.</li><li><h3>Cons:</h3>Fitteds are not waterproof and require a diaper cover. They can also be expensive depending on the brand. </li></ul><br><h3>Contour diapers</h3><br><p>Contours are a type of fitted cloth diaper.</p><ul><li></h3>Pros:</h3>Shaped the same as regular fitteds, and are just as absorbent and breathable.</li><li><h3>Cons:</h3>Contours don't come with snaps. They need to be fastened with a diaper fastener or pins. They also require a diaper cover. </li></ul><br><h3>Hybrid or all-in-two diapers</h3><p>These diapers are part-disposable and part-cloth. They have a reusable outer cover, and it's up to parents to decide whether they want to use a disposable or a reusable insert that they can change out when it's dirty.</p><ul><li><h3>Pros:</h3>Hybrids are adjustable, breathable, and more absorbent than regular fitted diapers due to an extra layer of fabric in the diaper. They're a little easier to wash than fitteds and contours, and are better for the environment than disposable diapers. With all-in-twos, the insert gets tucked or snapped back into the diaper.</li><li><h3>Cons:</h3>Hybrids may be more expensive than fitteds. They're also not waterproof, and require a waterproof outer cover. </li></ul><br><h3>Pocket diapers</h3><p>Pocket diapers have a waterproof outer cover and an opening for removable inserts.</p><ul><li><h3>Pros:</h3>Pockets come with velcro or snaps and don't require any extra folding or diaper pins. Many are lined with super-absorbent materials that keep the diaper feeling dry even when it's wet. They don't require a diaper cover, and parents can adjust the absorbency by adding more inserts into the pocket of the diaper.</li><li><h3>Cons:</h3>You'll have to add inserts back into the diaper after each washing.</li></ul><br><h3>Sleeve diapers</h3><p>These are cloth diapers that are a lot like pocket diapers, but they have an opening on the front and back of the diaper.</p><ul><li><h3>Pros:</h3>Inserts come out in the wash, meaning parents don't have to remove the inserts themselves.

    "body": "<p>Newborn babies have some interesting noises and behaviors that may leave parents wondering, \u201cis that normal?\u201d Many of these \u201cnormal\u201d newborn behaviors are due to reflexes that they have. If you are ever worried about your baby, the best thing to do is always to ask your pediatrician. Don\u2019t be shy, chances are many other parents have asked these same questions. Here are some common and \u201cnormal\u201d behaviors that you may see your newborn do during the first few months of life.</p><br><h3>Hiccups:</h3>These are very normal in a newborn and often, babies do not seem bothered by them. You may find that breastfeeding or sucking on a pacifier may help to get rid of them. However, there is no need to worry as they will stop on their own.<br><h3>Sneezing:</h3>Many parents think that when their newborn sneezes, they have a cold. However, babies also sneeze to clear germs and particles out of their airways as a natural defense against illness. It is their way of clearing their tiny airway, since they cannot blow their nose.<br><h3>Crossing of rolling the eyes:</h3>Newborn babies have uncoordinated eye movements. You may notice your baby cross their eyes, or roll them. As your baby grows, and with time, the muscles of the eye strengthen and you will see this improve.<br><h3>Startle reflex:</h3>You may notice your baby startle, or jump in response to a loud noise or movement. Sometimes, they do this even without an apparent reason. You will see them throw their head back and extend out their arms and legs, and then cry and pull them back in again.  This is a very normal and involuntary response, called the Moro reflex that typically disappears by month 3. A tight swaddle can help your infant feel secure and prevent them from startling or waking themselves up from this reflex.<br><h3>Noisy breathing</h3><p>Newborns breathe much more rapidly than an adult. In fact, in just one minute, they may take anywhere from 40 to 60 breaths. You will notice their breathing is not constantly rhythmic and that they take rapid, shallow breaths. Sometimes, they pause a few seconds and then take another breath, which is called \u201cperiodic breathing.\u201d With time, babies will outgrow this pattern of breathing. If your baby ever looks blue or dusky in color, if they are coughing or wheezing, or you are concerned or worried about their breathing you should always call for help.</p>",

    "body": "<p>If you\u2019re planning to nurse Baby, it\u2019s never to early to start thinking about what you can do - and what gear you may want - to help support a positive breastfeeding experience. Some moms find that they\u2019re a bit more comfortable nursing in public when they have a little something to help cover up. And some babies - especially once they\u2019re breastfeeding beyond the newborn stage - can benefit from being able to nurse with fewer distractions from the ever-more-exciting outside world.</p><p>Some moms just grab an extra swaddling blanket to use as a coverup and others prefer something designed with nursing in mind. Of course, once Baby arrives, you also have to see what works best for the both of you; some little ones don\u2019t want to be too covered up or don\u2019t want to nurse if they can\u2019t see their mother while doing so, and some moms find certains kind of coverups to be more comfortable, while others prefer to do without them entirely. It can be helpful to consider a range of styles of cover-up - either as an addition to your wardrobe now that can also be used to nurse your little one later, as something useful that you\u2019ll want to add to your registry, or as a purchase to be made once Baby arrives when you two get into the swing of nursing.  </p><p><h3>Uniqlo Frame-Print 2-Way Stole</h3><p>This versatile wool-blend stole is a hip addition to any wardrobe. Available in three colors, it can be worn as a roomy wrap - with tons of fabric to drape across your chest as Baby nurses - and also as a scarf-like stole around your neck. Really, any kind of open-front sweater, shawl, or wrap that is similarly roomy can do great double duty by keeping you stylish and cozy, and also being at the ready to be draped as a coverup once your little one is hungry. For warmer weather, keep an eye out for similar silhouettes in thin, breathable fabric.</p><h3>Motherhood Maternity Pull Over 2 Button Closure Nursing Cardigan</h3><p>If you\u2019re looking for something similar - a drapey top for layering that you wear whether nursing or not, but that can certainly be there for you when Baby needs to nurse - then this could be for you. In three neutral colors so you can wear it with almost anything, this simple cardigan not only fits the bill, it even has buttons at the shoulder so that when you drape the fabric in such a way that you can cover yourself while nursing, you can be confident that the fabric will stay put.  </p><h3>Seraphine Grey Nursing Cover Maternity Shawl</h3><p>Another versatile and stylish option that may very well find its way into your regular wardrobe, this bamboo wool blend shawl can be wrapped and draped in a number of ways. With snaps at one shoulder, it can be worn as a shawl, wrapped as a scarf, or used as a cozy baby blanket in a pinch.</p><h3>Nuroo Nursing Scarf in Indigo Diamond</h3><p>The Nuroo Nursing scarf comes in a number of different prints, and has snaps all along the width of the scarf so that you can wear it a variety of ways - including in stylish fashion when not breastfeeding - and adjust it when you\u2019re ready to nurse in a way that\u2019s comfortable for you.</p><h3>Bebe Au Lait Cotton Jersey Nursing Scarf in Mayura</h3><p>Another nursing scarf that comes in a number of designs, designed to help you look good even when you're not using it to feed Baby. And this infinity scarf is made of cotton jersey, so it\u2019s also soft, stretchy, and gets the job done.</p><h3>Bebe au Lait Premium Cotton Nursing Cover in Nest</h3><p>A nursing cover that doesn\u2019t necessarily need to dress itself up as anything else, and this option is popular with breastfeeding moms for good reason. This cover also comes in a lot of prints and patterns, and it's cleverly designed - the cotton cover fits a lot like an apron or a bib, has an adjustable neck strap, and has roomy coverage on the sides for plenty of privacy. It also boasts a structured neckline that allows for air flow, and for mom and baby to be able to see each other during nursing - this last detail is a huge plus and something that can be trickier to accomplish with other coverups. It even has internal terry cloth pockets to hold breast pads or a pacifier while nursing, and for quick cleanups after nursing.</p><h3>Milk Snob Multifunctional Cover - French Floral</h3><p>Finally, if you want your nursing cover to multitask not just as a garment for you, but as a stylish gear accessory for your baby, this could be the one for you. When you\u2019re not wearing this to nurse Baby, it can serve as a fitted car seat cover - just be careful when using any sort of car seat or stroller covers in hot weather, to br sure your little one doesn\u2019t overheat. Also available in a number of patterns, you can choose something chic - like floral prints or understated stripes - or super fun - like colorful brushstrokes or jaunty zebras.</p>",

    "body": "<p>In a larger sense, it\u2019s not a huge deal - Baby is going to love you just the same no matter what name she calls out in the middle of the night when she is looking for comfort after a nightmare. In a more day-to-day sense, though, what name your child calls you is kind of important - it\u2019s a name you\u2019re going to hear several thousand times a day, so it had better be one you\u2019re comfortable with. Of course, for parents in non-traditional families, this isn't always a clear-cut issue, either because you and your partner are gravitating towards the same parental title or because one or both of you don\u2019t feel comfortable using any of the most common parent names that come to mind. But one of the cool things about making your own rules is that your options for what names you can use are pretty much endless. Here are a few ideas:</p><h3>Sharing is caring</h3><p>The fact that you know that you want to be known as \u201cmom\u201d to your children doesn\u2019t mean that your partner can\u2019t opt for a similar title. You can cut down on confusion either by using variations on the same name (\u201cdad\u201d and \u201cdaddy,\u201d say, or \u201cmommy\u201d and \u201cmomma\u201d) or by using the parent names associated with different cultures if you and your partner have different cultural backgrounds, but even that isn\u2019t a requirement. Many families say they use the same parent-name for both parents, and most of the time this doesn\u2019t cause any confusion. Even on the rare case when it does, it\u2019s not the end of the world if both of Baby\u2019s dads come running when she scrapes her knee and needs someone to kiss it better.</p><h3>What's in a name?</h3><p>Plenty of parents who fall under the LGBTQ umbrella feel that the way they present themselves to the rest of the world, and the rest of the people who love them, is also best way to present themselves to their children - with their first names. Kids who call their parents by their first names are not uncommon, even if it seems a little bit quirky. And if you\u2019re not sure you want to commit to that level of quirk right away, there\u2019s always the option of \u201cmommy [name]\u201d or \u201c[name]-dad.\u201d</p><h3>Striking out into the unknown</h3><p>Some parents feel like traditional parenting terms don\u2019t really fit them as people or fit their relationships with their children, but they don\u2019t want to miss out on the fun of a sweet, toddler-mumbled parenting title. If that\u2019s the case for you or your partner, picking out a new, invented name might be the best way to go. Whether it\u2019s a diminutive of \u201cparent\u201d or just a couple of syllables you like that might be easy for a toddler to adapt to, the best name for you or your partner might be right on the tip of your tongue. Take a little time to try out a couple of repeated-sound names, and see if anything sticks.</p><h3>Kids will be kids</h3><p>No matter what you and your partner decide that you\u2019d like to be called, there\u2019s no guarantee that Baby won\u2019t end up taking matters into her own hands - or her own words. No matter what you start out calling yourself or your partner when you\u2019re talking to Baby, be prepared that she might start rebelling early and rename one or both of you.</p>",

    "body": "<p>Disappointment with your baby's sex isn\u2019t a topic that appears at the forefront of literature about pregnancy and childbirth, but for anyone who\u2019s experienced it, it can be a major part of pregnancy. Maybe the topic isn\u2019t discussed because women feel guilty for being in any way disappointed about their child. Denying the feelings doesn\u2019t help, though, and knowing that you\u2019re not alone can help you come to terms not just with the disappointment about gender, but the complicated feelings you think you shouldn\u2019t have.</p><p>I know all this because I experienced it myself. I have a lovely girl and three precious boys. Long before I was pregnant with our fourth child, I knew I wanted a second daughter. I have a sister and I wanted my daughter to have a sister as well. I also hoped for another child who, like me, was female, and who I wouldn\u2019t \u201close\u201d to marriage like I envisioned happening with my sons when they have wives of their own. These were the thoughts in my mind as I hoped for second little girl.</p><p>My ultrasound at 13 weeks came with the sonographer\u2019s \u201c90 percent\u201d certainty that we were going to have a third boy and I began to adjust my vision of what our family was going to look like. I couldn\u2019t quite let go of that 10 percent hope. And, yes, I felt incredibly guilty that a part of me wanted something different than the baby that was in my belly.</p><p>What made my experience even trickier was that my daughter desperately wanted a sister as well - and she wasn\u2019t as subtle about hiding her feelings of disappointment. Every time she got annoyed with her brothers, she\u2019d proclaim, often in tears, \u201cThis is why I don\u2019t want another brother!\u201d</p><p>I was in the odd position of helping her work through feelings that I myself hadn\u2019t worked through. We brought all the children to the 20-week ultrasound and I hoped that my daughter seeing the baby on the ultrasound screen would help her feel happier about the baby. No such luck. We got definitive \u201cboy\u201d news and, while I was somewhat relieved to not have cling to a 10 percent chance anymore, it was a bitter pill for her.</p><p>Interestingly, I think being forced to vocalize the positive as I helped my daughter through her disappointment also helped me address my own. Hearing myself say things like, \u201cOur baby is part of our family. He can\u2019t help that he\u2019s a boy! He deserves our love\u201d and \u201cJust you wait. You\u2019ll fall in love with him as soon as you see him\u201d was a way to grapple with feelings that I could barely bring myself to acknowledge.</p><p>I\u2019m sure I don\u2019t even need to say that I loved my baby, boy or not, before he was born. But as soon as he was born, all the inner whispers of wishing he had maybe been a girl utterly evaporated. I fell head over heels in love with him and, instantly, couldn\u2019t imagine our family without him. I\u2019m happy to report that my daughter experienced the same as soon as she held her baby brother. She told me repeatedly, \u201cMommy, I love him so much. Mommy, I don\u2019t care that he\u2019s a boy.\u201d Me neither, baby girl. He\u2019s exactly what we were missing.</p>",

    "body": "<p>Even during pregnancy, there are probably a lot of things that you need to get done on a daily basis. You might have to run into the office, take long bus rides, go grocery shopping, oh and don\u2019t forget about that lunch date you have with your friends after you get back from the gym. Basically, life goes on. Only, you have one extra thing to worry about, and that\u2019s your baby, and rushing around can pose some perceived hazards. Your workouts may involve a bunch of movement or dancing, getting off the bus may involve some squeezing and bumping into people (especially during rush hour), and even grocery shopping can have the occasional cart fender-bender.</p><p>All of this may have you a little worried about your baby\u2019s safety while she\u2019s still growing inside of you. But when you have an unborn baby to look after, you also have a friend on your side, whose purpose is to help you protect your baby through all of life\u2019s daily aches and pains. Meet the amniotic sac!</p><h3>Amniotic sac</h3><p>The amniotic sac is filled with the famous \u201cwater\u201d that breaks before, or shortly after labor begins. However, the amniotic sac does a lot more than serve as an indicator that your baby is on the way. The amniotic sac is a protective barrier between your baby and the outside world. It\u2019s also where your baby grows and lives through your pregnancy. The amniotic sac has two layers, often referred to as \u201cmembranes,\u201d called the chorion and the amnion. The inner membrane (the amnion), contains your growing baby along with a special amniotic fluid that surrounds them. The outer membrane (the chorion), then wraps around the entire inner layer. In short, Baby has a smooth and very tough bubble surrounding her. So even with the occasional bump, Baby should still be snug and safe.</p><h3>Amniotic fluid</h3><p>Only days after conception, the amniotic sac is already forming and preparing to become your baby\u2019s home and personal dance studio. The clear or yellow liquid that fills this sac is the amniotic fluid. This is yet another form of protection that your body provides, and it comes with a variety of functions:</p><ul><li>The famous umbilical cord is responsible for providing a lot for your baby, like oxygen-rich blood and nutrients. But the unsung hero of the story is the amniotic fluid. Though it takes a supporting role, the amniotic fluid makes sure that the umbilical cord can do its job. Because of the fluid inside the amniotic sac, the umbilical cord gets to float around freely without getting compressed when Baby starts to move around.</li><li>Ever heard of water aerobics? Well, it\u2019s a pretty good way to develop muscles. That\u2019s what your baby is doing right now! Stretching and kicking in the amniotic sac is helping her develop muscles to get nice and strong for when she arrives.</li><li>Speaking of water, have you ever stayed in the bath too long, without the hot water running? Not a very pleasant experience, is it? The water can get cold pretty quickly. Fortunately, Baby doesn\u2019t have to deal with this problem during her time in the amniotic sac! The amniotic sac helps to regulate her body temperature before she can do it on her own, keeping her warm. If only there was a bathtub that did the same, we\u2019d never leave!</li><li>The amniotic fluid is also pretty slippery, which is actually a good thing. The consistency helps your baby\u2019s skin stay nice and soft by not letting her arms and legs rub against each other. This can also help prevent the webbing of fingers and toes.</li><li>Again, the umbilical cord is famous for providing nutrients, but the amniotic fluid is full of antibodies! These antibodies will help Baby by preventing infection, or viruses. For right now, the amniotic sac has taken responsibility of being a strong barrier between your baby and harmful bacteria.</li><li>Last but not least, the amniotic sac helps your baby practice breathing and swallowing. In the beginning, the amniotic sac is filled of water that comes from your body. Later, your baby will start to take in that water to develop lungs and a digestive system. And as they say, what goes in must come out. Your baby will start to fill the amniotic sac with their urine, and well, take in that urine again. Rinse and repeat. It\u2019s perfectly natural, so even though we wouldn\u2019t do it nowadays as adults, Baby has to make do with what she has, and the process helps her get stronger!</li></ul><br><h3>The takeaway</h3><p>When you\u2019re going about daily life, it\u2019s good to be aware of your surroundings and not bump into things too much, but there are some things you just can\u2019t avoid. It may bring some peace of mind knowing that the amniotic sac is always in your corner.</p>",

    "body": "<p>As the pregnancy train travels down the tracks, there is one thing that you and your family may be enjoying, and that\u2019s talking to your baby! you might also share the urge to share some of your favorite music (to ensure that Baby knows exactly who The Beatles are when she arrives of course).</p><p>Both of these are great ways to bond with Baby before she\u2019s born. You don\u2019t even need headphones to show her all the wonders of your music collection. She can attend the home concert comfortably from her seat, and the distance from the speakers could help keep her ears safe while they\u2019re still developing. But if you\u2019ve been using regular headphones, don\u2019t worry, just make sure to keep the volume on the softer side (around 50 decibels, or the sound level of a quiet washing machine) and try to make the jam sessions with headphones fairly short. You could also look into specialized speakers that are made to safely transmit sound straight from your baby bump.</p><p>According to Mayo Clinic, somewhere around the 25 week mark is when your baby will start to recognize familiar voices and sounds. This means that all of the love you\u2019ve been giving won\u2019t go unnoticed, and your favorite bands will be heard loud and clear. Studies have even found that all of this singing and talking could have a pretty neat impact after birth.</p><p>We all know that babies don\u2019t come out reciting Shakespeare and singing show tunes, but because of what they were exposed to in the womb, they may already be pretty adept at recognizing the speech and rhythm patterns of those plays and songs. The building blocks for language have already been laid out by the time a baby is born, and they start to use those skills right away.</p><p>It might be kinda funny to say that babies might already have \u201cmemories\u201d of people talking or singing before they\u2019ve come into the world, but is it that far off? Well, yes and no. Babies have no context for those silly sounds we call words, but just like recognizing their parent\u2019s voice, they can recognize certain speech patterns and pronunciations.</p><p>Think of it this way: if you hear the word, \u201cerinaceous,\u201d you may not know exactly what it means (we promise it\u2019s a real word), and it can easily be forgotten, especially if you don\u2019t know the meaning. But, if you hear it enough, at some point you\u2019ll be able to hear the word out of the blue and say, \u201cyes, I recognize that word!\u201d Even if you still don\u2019t know what it means, the sound will probably become familiar. It\u2019s very similar with babies. A study actually tested this by asking expecting parents to play a recording of a made-up word, \u201ctatata\u201d with some music mixed in to their unborn babies. When those babies were born, they had heard that word about 25,000 times with various pronunciations and speech patterns. Then, once those bundles of joy were in the world for about a month, they were brought in again to listen to the same recordings.</p><p>By looking at the neural signs that they were giving off, the study was able to determine that the babies were actually able to recognize \u201ctatata,\u201d even when pronounced in different ways and at different pitches when they hadn\u2019t heard the word since they were in the womb! The findings were then compared to the reactions of babies that were not exposed to the same sounds. Since it\u2019s a made-up word, no surprise, the babies in the control group didn\u2019t recognize it. The control group also had a little more difficulty with differentiating the different variations of \u201ctatata,\u201d leading the team to believe that babies might actually learn a lot more about language and pronunciation before they\u2019re born than they previously thought.</p><p>Now, you may be wondering if your baby will be behind in life because you haven\u2019t been talking in different accents and languages before they arrive. Don\u2019t worry, there\u2019s no evidence that\u2019s the case. Babies don\u2019t really have the same challenges adults or older children have when trying to learn new words and languages. They\u2019re pretty much blank slates, and almost every word and sound is new to them at a month old (especially made-up ones). All this really means is that your baby is always listening, and always learning from the world around her even before she\u2019s born. So continue talking, continue singing, and your baby might come out recognizing more than just your voice!</p>",

Unfortunately, the chemical processes by which caffeine gives you that boost are not super healthy for you or Baby while you\u2019re pregnant.</p><br><h3>How can caffeine hurt you?</h3><p>Even though caffeine seems to naturally give you a bunch of energy, the chemical processes it uses to do so are not so great for you while you\u2019re pregnant. Caffeine is a diuretic, which means it\u2019ll increase the frequency with which you need to pee, which is usually already elevated during pregnancy. This can lead to dehydration.</p><br><p>Caffeine is most often used as a stimulant to help get you up in the morning, however this can make getting precious sleep more difficult. Like other stimulants, caffeine raises both the heart rate and blood pressure, which can put you in serious harm during pregnancy. High blood pressure during pregnancy is associated with the dangerous complication preeclampsia, while an elevated heart rate can be dangerous for both you and your baby overall.</p><br><h3>How can caffeine hurt Baby?</h3><br><p>Baby totally depends on you for vitamins and nutrients while you\u2019re pregnant, and she tends to eat, drink or breathe whatever you have. Babies have more trouble processing caffeine than adults, so it can affect them very seriously.</p><br><p>Research is still inconclusive about caffeine\u2019s effects on developing babies, but some seems to suggest that babies of women who drink excess caffeine while pregnant may be at an elevated risk for low birth-weight, birth defects, and miscarriage.</p><br><h3>What\u2019s the verdict?</h3><br><p>Drinking a limited amount of caffeine a day (under 200 mg, or about one or two small cups of coffee) will probably not result in any developmental disorders or miscarriage, but all women are different, and so are all babies. Women who want to completely eliminate any threat posed by caffeine can abstain, though simply limiting the caffeine intake should be enough to mitigate any risk. And always be sure to check the amount of caffeine in any coffee, tea, or soda, because the amounts can vary quite a bit. And, of course, check in with your healthcare provider for more guidance. </p></div>",

Some healthcare providers may differ on what amount of alcohol, if any, is safe during pregnancy.</p><br><h3>What are the risks of alcohol?</h3><br><p>When you\u2019re pregnant, your baby is totally dependent on you for all the nutrients that they will need to grow big and strong.</p><br><p>Believe it or not, alcohol is technically a poison, and can seriously alter the mental functioning of an adult, and even more so a gestating baby. Oxygen and nutrients flow to the bloodstream through the placenta, so when you drink alcohol, some of that will get absorbed. Everybody has enzymes that break down alcohol, but these enzymes are found in different quantities in different people, so some people take longer than others to get the booze out of their system- chances are, a developing baby won\u2019t have nearly enough enzymes yet to constantly detoxify the blood, so repeated exposure to too much can lead to an elevated risk for various forms of stunted development, stillbirth, and Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders (FASDs).</p><br><h3>Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders</h3><br><p>Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders (FASD) are permanent defects and disabilities that can appear in children whose mothers drank alcohol while pregnant, and the symptoms range from mild to severe, depending on the case. Children with FASD may display any number of the following symptoms:</p><ul><li>Small eyes, upturned nose, and a smooth area between the nose and upper lip</li><li>Learning disabilities, mild to severe</li><li>Heart problems, issues with other organs</li><li>Distinctively small head</li><li>Vision and hearing problems</li><li>Below-average height and weight</li><li>Poor fine-motor development, coordination</li></ul><br><p>Women who drank while pregnant that notice any of these symptoms in their child should let their healthcare provider know how much, and how often they drank to determine whether the alcohol may have played a role in the child\u2019s disorder.</p><h3>The bottom line</h3><br><p>Simply put, nobody knows how much alcohol it takes to negatively impact a pregnancy, so ACOG and many other organizations take a hard stance against it. You should talk to your healthcare provider if you have questions about alcohol during pregnancy.</p></div>",

The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists recommends a daily intake of 27 mg/day for pregnant women.</p><br><h3>How does iron help during pregnancy?</h3><br><p>Iron\u2019s primary (though very much not only) function is to help construct healthy red blood cells in order to successfully distribute oxygen across the body. Once pregnant, your blood volume is going to increase by as much as 50%, meaning you need to really up your iron intake in order to produce a sufficient amount of red blood cells. Baby is also dependent on your nutrients, and your iron, for quite a time, meaning she will need to borrow (not that she\u2019ll be paying it back) your iron to construct her own red blood cells. Iron also helps build myoglobin, the protein that delivers oxygen to the muscles, allowing Baby to grow big and strong. Iron-deficiency during pregnancy is related to low birth weight, premature birth, and heart problems, so the importance of consuming enough cannot be overstated.</p><br><h3>What are some good sources of iron?</h3><ul><li><h5>Spinach:</h5><p>Popeye sure had this one down! One cup of cooked spinach has about 6.5 mg of iron, representing a very good chunk of the daily recommended amount</p></li><br><li><h5>Iron-fortified cereal:</h5><p>Cereals like Cheerios, Special K, and Raisin Bran all contain very healthy amounts of iron. Not all cereals are iron-fortified, however, so it\u2019s important to make sure you choose one that is rich in iron</p></li><br><li><h5>Red meat:</h5><p>Red meat, whether steak, beef, or burger is very high in iron content. However, the benefits of the iron in red meat must be weighed against red meat\u2019s not so healthful aspects before deciding on filet mignon as your go-to iron choice during pregnancy</p></li><br><li><h5>Beans: </h5><p>Many beans, including kidney, lima and Navy beans have a very high iron content. Beans are a great source of iron (and protein), particularly for a vegetarian who may have trouble finding their daily suggested amount otherwise</p></li></ul></div>",

It also plays a hefty role in supporting the immune system, facilitating messages from the brain to elsewhere in the body, and helping muscles move. Although the body produces Vitamin D when exposed to direct sunlight, it can be difficult to rely on sunshine alone to account for the total Vitamin D requirements for you and Baby, as being indoors, in the shade, or beneath a cloudy sky will reduce the amount of Vitamin D your body produces, and every pregnant mom should know that it is not a good idea to linger in the sun for extended periods of time. Women with darker skin also produce less Vitamin D than needed. The Institute of Medicine has established a recommended daily allowance (RDA) of 600 IU Vitamin D for pregnant women.</p><br><h3>How does Vitamin D help?</h3><br><p>Vitamin D helps both mom and Baby\u2019s bone formation and immune system development, as well as helping her brain begin to communicate with the rest of her body, and making her little arms and legs rustle and kick about. Vitamin D has traditionally been afforded great reverence as a staple pregnancy nutrient, and many researchers believe that ample Vitamin D intake will help prevent bone density problems like rickets and osteomalacia once Baby grows up a little bit. According to Philip Steer of Imperial College London, those who are considered at-risk for Vitamin D deficiency, and may therefore want to speak to their healthcare providers about supplementation include: \u201cwomen of South Asian, black African, black Caribbean or Middle Eastern origin, as well as women with little exposure to sunlight or who were obese before pregnancy.\u201d</p><br><h3>What are some good sources of Vitamin D?</h3><br><p>Vitamin D does not naturally occur in very many food products, but lots of cereals, eggs, juices, milk, and other products are Vitamin D-fortified, providing you some additional Vitamin D beyond the sun\u2019s rays. Just about all prenatal vitamins will contain Vitamin D, usually about 400 IU worth, which when combined with the amount that your body will naturally produce, and your consumption of Vitamin D-fortified foods, should result in reaching and surpassing your daily target of Vitamin D. Check the nutritional information on the back of the box to see if your food and drink choices are Vitamin D-fortified. You should also talk to your healthcare provider if you have any questions about your Vitamin D intake during pregnancy.</p></div>",

Here is a list of foods to definitely avoid when you\u2019ve got a bun in the oven.</p><br><h3>Raw fish, meat, eggs, or unpasteurized milk</h3><br><p>Consuming raw fish, meat, milk or eggs puts you at risk of exposure to harmful bacteria like coliform bacteria, salmonella, and e. coli, or could cause toxoplasmosis, a serious parasitic infection.</p><br><p><h3>Healthy alternative:</h3>Meat must be cooked to a safe temperature (145-160 degrees Fahrenheit, 63-71 Celsius, depending on the type) in order to fully ensure that it will not contain harmful parasites and bacteria. When ordering at a restaurant, it's always safer to ask for the meat cooked medium or above when pregnant. Raw eggs and milk should be avoided, but cooked eggs and pasteurized milk are super important during pregnancy, so make sure they aren\u2019t raw!</p><br><h3>Deli meat</h3><br><p>Deli meat can contain listeria, which can make you sick and put your baby at risk.</p><br><p><h3>Healthy alternative:</h3>If you can't bear the thought of going through your pregnacy without roast beef sandwiches, it's best to steam the meat to at least 165 degrees Fahrenheit (74 Celsius).</p><br><h3>Fish high in mercury</h3><br><p>Pregnant women should avoid eating fish that are high in mercury like shark and swordfish, as mercury can seriously harm fetal brain development.</p><br><p><h3>Healthy alternative:</h3>Bass, cod, halibut, mahi mahi, salmon, and tuna among others contain relatively low levels of mercury compared to others, but you should still limit your consumption to 6 ounces a week, and make sure everything is fully cooked.</p><br><h3>Smoked seafood</h3><br><p>Smoked seafood may contain listeria, which could make both you and your baby sick. Canned smoked seafoods are safe to eat while pregnant, but refrigerated ones should be avoided.</p><br><p><h3>Healthy alternative:</h3>As a safer alternative to smoked seafood, try grilling or baking your fish.</p>br><h3>Raw shellfish</h3><br><p>Raw shellfish like oysters and clams may contain dangerous viruses and bacteria, which could lead to devastating disease in both you and your baby.</p><br><p><h3>Healthy alternative:</h3>Shellfish must be cooked throughout before eating them during pregnancy, as they could play host to many potentially harmful bacteria.</p>br><h3>Soft cheeses</h3><br><p>Brie, feta, Camembert, Panela, and other raw milk products should be avoided during pregnancy, unless their labels say that they're made from pasteurized milk.</p><br><p><h3>Healthy alternative:</h3>Though many soft, unpasteurized cheeses are a no-no, hard cheeses like American, Cheddar, and Swiss are perfectly healthy to eat during pregnancy and are rich in calcium, among other vital gestational nutrients. Pasteurized cheese spreads, cream cheese, cottage cheese, and semi-soft mozzarella are safe to eat as well.</p>br><h3>Alcohol</h3><br><p>Alcohol can have devastating effects on a baby's growth and cause Fetal Alcohol Syndrome, which results in stunted development and learning troubles for your child, as well as physical problems affecting the kidneys, vision, or bones.</p><br><p><h3>Healthy alternative:</h3>Mocktails are fruity, fun drinks that will dazzle your taste buds without any booze! There are lots of great mocktail recipes out there; check them out!</p>br><h3>Unwashed vegetables</h3><br><p>Unwashed vegetables put you at risk of contracting toxoplasmosis, a serious parasitic infection that could cause miscarriage or stillbirth.</p><br><p><h3>Healthy alternative:</h3>Veggies are probably the most important overall food group to eat during pregnancy, just make sure that they're totally washed and clean!</p>br><h3>Unpasteurized juices or ciders</h3><br><p>Unpasteurized juice or ciders may contain the bacteria listeria, which could make you or your baby very ill, so it is best to avoid these during pregnancy.</p><br><p><h3>Healthy alternative:</h3>All fruit juices or cider should be pasteurized before drinking them, so make sure that you check out all fruit beverages you drink.</p>br><h3>Raw or undercooked sprouts</h3><br><p>Raw or undercooked sprouts may contain e. coli or salmonella bacteria, and should be avoided during pregnancy.</p><br><p><h3>Healthy alternative:</h3>Like anything that contains harmful bacteria in its raw state, sprouts should definitely be cooked before eating them while pregnant.</p><br><p>You should call your healthcare provider about the pregnancy safety about any food you are unsure about.</p></div>",

Fetuses draw from all the food you eat, so the amount of calcium in your diet dictates their rate of cardiovascular, skeletal, and neurological growth. You should be getting about 1000 mg of calcium per day, which is equivalent to 3 or 4 servings of dairy.</p><br><h3>How does calcium help during pregnancy?</h3><br><p>As a fetus' body develops, calcium is essential for strong bones and a healthy heart. Babies take calcium from mothers\u2019 bones if there is an insufficient amount in the food stream, so a well-rounded diet is particularly important to minimize risk for both mom and child. It is such a fundamental part of your diet that while you\u2019re pregnant, you have an intrinsic ability to absorb more calcium from food, particularly in the second half of pregnancy when bone development is rapid. Calcium also helps prevent bone damage while breastfeeding, when you need extra calcium for breast milk and your body is producing less estrogen to protect your bones.</p><br><p>Ample calcium during pregnancy is also proven to help protect you against osteoporosis later in life.</p><br><h3>What are some good sources of calcium?</h3><br><ul><li><h3>Yogurt:<h/h3>8 ounces of fruit yogurt satisfies about \u2153 of your daily calcium requirement.

Most experts recommend limiting your caffeine intake to less than 200 mg a day (which is about one or two small cups of coffee), since this amount doesn't pose a risk to pregnancy and the effects of larger amounts are unknown. But do you usually start the afternoon with a venti latte? Or order soda every time you go to a restaurant? Then you probably weren\u2019t terribly excited to hear about these recommendations.

    "body": "<div class='body-nutrition'><p>Have you already been feeling like it\u2019s really difficult to stop at eating just one of your favorite cookies? Or maybe you\u2019ve been seriously hankering for a veggie dish you never normally eat? Whether these cravings are sweet, salty, strange, or of the healthy variety, these feelings are common among expecting moms. And when the cravings hit, they can sometimes feel overwhelming. Luckily, once you better understand these cravings, there are some very real ways you can manage them and continue to eat healthy.</p><br><h3>Why do you have these cravings?</h3><br><p>There isn\u2019t clear evidence that explains exactly what causes you to hunger for that ice cream or be hankering for those dill pickles. It could be your body\u2019s need for more food to nourish Baby. But, like so many unusual events during pregnancy, it likely has to do with hormones. The hormones surging through your body can make your sense of smell stronger, which can cause you to find certain foods irresistible. (The flip side of this is that your new superhuman sense of smell could also make certain foods seem disgusting, even foods that might be a totally normal part of your regular diet.) So if your body does seem to be driving you crazy with cravings, just how do you manage?</p><br><h3>Do you actually need to be \u2018eating for two\u2019?</h3><br><p>The tough part about these cravings is that many women experience them most strongly during the first trimester, which - if you\u2019re of a healthy weight at the start of your pregnancy - is when you don\u2019t really need to be taking in any extra calories yet. By the second and third trimesters, you should be taking in some extra calories. For most women, this means roughly 300 more calories a day during the second trimester and roughly 500 more than your baseline during the third. (But you should, of course, check in with your healthcare provider to make sure these recommendations make sense for your own unique nutrition needs.) So if you\u2019re experiencing some healthy cravings later on, know that you\u2019ll need a little something extra added to your usual diet anyway. But early on, intense cravings can sometimes pose a problem. Fortunately, there are a few tricks that can help you manage.</p><br><h3>What can you do to manage your cravings?</h3><br><ul><li><h3>Eat a good breakfast:</h3>Eating a hearty, healthy breakfast will keep you feeling full and limit your cravings, especially in the morning. Skipping breakfast will make you more susceptible to cravings, so make sure to eat up early!</li><br><li><h3>Exercise:</h3>Exercise provides numerous benefits during pregnancy - which is why it\u2019s recommended that you get about 30 minutes of it each day - and one benefit is the possible curbing of cravings. A good workout routine allows your body to produce endorphins, which help you to feel happy and satisfied without the extra snacks.</li><br><li><h3>Anticipate:</h3>Keeping healthy snacks on hand to have in between meals can allow you to stay satiated before a craving even sneaks up or can help satisfy your craving in nutritious fashion once it makes itself known. Plus, many pregnant women find having a number of smaller meals throughout the day or snacking healthily between larger meals helps to keep them feeling their best, especially early on when morning sickness might be rearing its ugly head. And in later trimesters when you do need those extra calories, having healthy snacks on hand will help set you up for making nutritious choices. </li><br><li><h3>Make smart choices: </h3>Sometimes, focusing on what\u2019s at the core of your craving can help. Need something sweet? Instead of cookies, indulge in fresh pineapple. How about salty? Instead of french fries, try some lightly salted popcorn. Creamy? Skip the ice cream and go for some yogurt loaded with healthy fats. And if you\u2019re craving a healthy dinner of herb roasted chicken, yummy saut\u00e9ed spinach, and mashed sweet potatoes? Just go for it!</li><br><li><h3>Control portions: </h3>Sometimes a craving for a specific food that\u2019s not the most healthy will be particularly intense and it might feel like nothing else will satisfy you. In these instances, let portion control be your guide. So if, for example, you feel like nothing other than potato chips will do, place a serving size in a bowl, put the full bag of chips away (even if it feels like you could easily polish the whole thing off - and sometimes it might), and then really enjoy those few chips. Portion control of cravings can be difficult, but if you can master it, you\u2019ll be treating your body well and the next craving won\u2019t seem so intimidating.</li><br><li><h3>Find stress relief that works for you:</h3>It\u2019s possible that cravings are just one way the body wants to handle the stress of pregnancy, and engaging in some other type of stress relief might help.

When lunchtime rolls around, you may be scrambling or in a rush to have something that will be healthy for you and Baby - the good news is that there are simple, healthy, yummy options for you to consider.</p><br><h3>What kinds of food should I have?</h3><br><p>You should eat foods rich in nutrients that will benefit you and Baby. The essential nutrients include vitamins A, C, D, E, B vitamins, folate (found in prenatal vitamins and fortified grains as folic acid), calcium, choline, DHA, iron, protein, and zinc. You don\u2019t need to have all these in one massive meal of several different foods. You can have them throughout the day, and you may be wondering where to find all these nutrients. There are many possibilities, but here is a list of some great lunches you can easily prepare on your own that have the essential nutrients to benefit you and Baby</p><br><h3>Perfect pregnancy lunches</h3><br><ul><li><h3>Egg salad:</h3>Eggs contain choline, an essential nutrient to help Baby\u2019s brain growth and development. Try it in a wrap or a sandwich.</li><br><li><h3>Cheese quesadilla:</h3>A quesadilla with preferably whole milk cheese contains protein, calcium, and other vitamins.</li><br><li><h3>Pita bread pizza:</h3>This pizza with some tomato sauce, veggies, and cheese has calcium, protein, and several vitamins and minerals found in vegetables.</li><br><li><h3>Vegetable soup: </h3>A veggie soup is loaded with essential vitamins and nutrients like folate, iron, and Vitamin A.</li><br><li><h3>Chopped chicken salad:</h3>This salad has protein, iron, and could have other nutrients depending on if you add vegetables or mix in any other good foods. Try adding tomatoes or other fruit to get vitamin C as well.</li><br><li><h3>Turkey burger:</h3>A good turkey burger with lean turkey could be topped with cheese or maybe a veggie spread. This meal will surely keep you full and provide you with several essential nutrients.</li></ul></div>",

The neural tube, the precursor to her brain and central nervous system, closes around Week 6, thanks in no small part to folate.</p><br><h3>What is the neural tube?</h3><br><p>The neural tube develops along Baby's tiny little back during the first few weeks after conception, and generally closes sometime during Week 6. The neural tube forms the basis for what eventually will become her brain, spinal cord, and entire central nervous system.</p><br><h3>Why is folate so important?</h3><br><p>Folate, known as folic acid in its synthetic form, is part of the B-vitamin group, and helps facilitate the growth of new cells. Folate is also critical to help the neural tube close, which then begins the proper central nervous system development. If the neural tube doesn't completely close, a baby could develop a serious complication, known as a neural tube defect (NTD). The impacts of different neural tube defects vary greatly, but most are quite serious. The importance of folate in preventing neural tube defects is so great that the United States now requires bread and other grains to be fortified with the nutrient.</p><br><h3>How do you get the needed folate/folic acid?</h3><br><p>Most providers recommend that women begin taking folic acid supplements at least a month before conceiving. The minimum amount recommended in pregnancy is 400 mcg, although most providers recommend closer to 1000 mcg. You'll probably get most of this in your prenatal vitamin. Other great sources of folate include enriched grains, leafy greens, and avocado. So long as you take your prenatal vitamin and maintain a well-balanced diet, most women have no problem with getting enough folate/folic acid, though some may require more. You should talk to your provider about how much is right for you.</p></div>",

Listeria can cause an infection called listeriosis, which can cross the placenta, and present serious problems for a baby. Listeria isn\u2019t a problem if the food is fully-cooked, however, so bacon is generally a safe food to eat as long as it\u2019s cooked thoroughly.</p><br><p>While thick, juicy bacon might be your preferred style, it\u2019s a good idea to eat crispy bacon instead. A chewier piece could have some undercooked parts and that can be dangerous.</p><br><h3>Handle with care</h3><br><p>To avoid contamination, don\u2019t store your raw bacon near other food in the fridge, and keep it wrapped and isolated. The juices from raw bacon can house listeria as well, and that can contaminate other foods. Be sure to wash your hands, utensils, and any surfaces that come in contact with raw meat during its preparation.</p><br><h3>Not all bacon is equal</h3><br><p>Depending on the brand you buy, or the restaurant you order it from, your bacon may have a lot of additives in it. Smoked or cured bacon is usually preserved with salt (and lots of it), but could also contain artificial preservatives. Look out for flavored bacon like \u201chickory smoked\u201d or \u201cmaple\u201d as it might just contain a bunch of artificial flavoring.</p><br><p>While none of these ingredients are inherently dangerous, sticking to more natural foods may help make for a healthier diet.</p><br><p>Bacon is a fatty, salty food, so try and keep your consumption of it under control. If you can. It\u2019s just...so delicious.</p><br><h3>Cooking methods</h3><br><p>If you cook bacon in a pan, be sure to cook the fatty ends until crispy. Sometimes the ends can sit on the wall of a pan, which doesn\u2019t get nearly as hot, and that will prevent your bacon from cooking all the way through.</p><br><p>For a really even cook, consider baking your bacon. Preheat your oven to 350-400F (177-204C), place your bacon on a cooking sheet with foil, and bake for around 15-20 minutes. You\u2019re aiming for an internal meat temperature of at least 165F (74C). This will give your bacon a safe, even cook without it getting overly crispy or burnt.</p><br><p>If you are reheating bacon, make sure to get its internal temperature up high again, as bacteria could grow on it while in the refrigerator.</p><br><h3>The bottom line</h3><br><p>When properly cooked, bacon is safe during pregnancy. However, it\u2019s very, very, VERY important that it is thoroughly cooked.</p></div>",

You should speak with you healthcare provider first before beginning any regimen of a natural remedy to help manage your symptoms.</p><br><h3>What are some common 'safe' natural remedies?</h3><ul><li><h3>Morning sickness/nausea:</h3>Among the most common symptoms of early pregnancy, morning sickness can be disruptive all day long, and can really interfere with all aspects of life, like proper eating, exercise, and comfort. As there are very few, if any, prescription drugs that are universally agreed to safely combat morning sickness, most moms battling it will opt for natural remedies. While exercise and proper hydration may be able to help, women battling morning sickness may also want to look into ginger and Vitamin B6 supplements, as these are both known to help reduce feelings of nausea. The FDA has also recently approved a morning sickness drug, known as Diclegis that combines Vitamin B6 with doxylamine succinate to help manage morning sickness. These ingredients are both available over-the-counter, but you should speak with your healthcare provider before taking a remedy like this.</li><br><li><h3>Heartburn:</h3>Some heartburn medications may be unsafe during pregnancy, so many women prefer to treat theirs naturally. Some believe that honey may help relieve the discomfort of acid reflux and heartburn, but a simple adjustment in diet towards more fresh fruits, vegetables, and meats, and drinking more water, may help treat the source of the problem. It may also help to avoid caffeine, spicy foods, and late night eating.</li><br><li><h3>Constipation/hemorrhoids:</h3>Like many other medications, those that treat constipation and hemorrhoids may not necessarily be safe for pregnancy, so many will prefer to treat these naturally. Maintaining a diet that is high in fiber will help you stay regular, battling against both constipation and hemorrhoids. Soaking in a Sitz bath can help deal with the discomfort of hemorrhoids if they have already appeared. Using witch hazel may also help you deal with any hemorrhoids.</li></ul><br><p>Although there are many natural remedies out there that are perfectly safe and helpful, you should always speak with your healthcare provider before using any as some, particularly herbals, may be unsafe for you or Baby.</p></div>",

Raw fish and sushi can contain parasites that can be dangerous for a developing baby in the womb. Because of this, The Mayo Clinic states that expecting mothers should avoid raw fish in every form.</p><br><h3>Canned tuna</h3><br><p>Depending on who you talk to, the issue of canned tuna is a little controversial. Consumer Reports published a study in the mid 2000s, and later a 2014 article, that showed that the levels of mercury in canned tuna can vary wildly from one can to the next.</p><br><p>Critics of the studies say that mercury poisoning from canned tuna could only come from frequent and prolonged exposure to the substance. Unless you\u2019re eating it every day, you just aren\u2019t likely to get that level of consistent exposure from canned tuna.</p><br><p>So although avoiding it completely is the safest strategy, you can almost completely reduce your risk of mercury exposure by keeping your intake to two cans or less of tuna per week. It\u2019s always a good idea to cook canned tuna, which might require some kitchen ingenuity.</p><br><h3>Tuna steaks</h3><br><p>Fish has a lot of beneficial properties for an expecting mom.

You want the internal temperature of the tuna to be at 145 degrees, or until all the flesh has changed color, begun to brown, and the meat separates easily with a fork.</p><br><p>A lot of tuna recipes center around only partially cooking the fish, leaving the steak red in the middle, so be careful which preparation method you choose. For now, you\u2019ll only want to follow a recipe that completely cooks your tuna. If you\u2019re in a restaurant, make sure your server knows you want it \u201cwell done.\u201d</p></div>",

There\u2019s certainly a lot in our culture - both more broadly in how women\u2019s looks have traditionally been valued within society, within diet culture, and even within \u201cnew mom\u201d culture - that contributes to the idea that new moms and parents who give birth should be unhappy with or need to \u201cfix\u201d their postpartum bodies and that they should focus their efforts on \u201cbouncing back\u201d or on \u201closing the baby weight.\u201d And there's a lucrative market for telling moms that they should maybe be unhappy with their bodies - even sometimes masquerading as self-empowerment or self-care or \u201ctaking your time back.\u201d I\u2019ve also seen a lot of pseudo-positive but actually shaming \u201cWhat\u2019s your excuse?\u201d style marketing, all of which makes me livid.</h3><br><h3>So it seems to me like there is, unfortunately, a lot of opportunity to feel, well, not so satisfied about one\u2019s body as it\u2019s going through a lot of these changes. What do you see as being the connection between body positivity, body image, and the major bodily changes that might be occurring during these periods?</h3><br><p>You summarized the contributions to risk really well. There's the cultural and societal pressure, and there\u2019s an entire industry built around profiting off of women in the perinatal period  (during pregnancy and after birth) and their shame around their body and the pressure to lose weight.</p><br><p>And, long term, when we\u2019re starting a relationship with a child from a place of \u201cI need to restrict my intake,\u201d it actually ends up potentially impacting one\u2019s ability to breastfeed, and when that child is a toddler or 10 years old and they\u2019re still seeing mom dieting off and on - that\u2019s behavior that\u2019s easily picked up even at a young age.</p><br><p>So it\u2019s something that is really worth spending some time with in the first year - to get to know \u201cHow can I be more comfortable in my body?\u201d If someone wants to think about, \u201cWhere am I at with my body image?\u201d it can be helpful to ask questions like, \u201cHow happy am I with my body size? How often do I think about my body size? Does it preoccupy my mind? What percentage of the time? How often am I making food choices based on my body size and how I want to change my body size?\u201d</p><br><p>And there are a lot of different clinical tools to measure eating behavior. One of my favorite ones is the Intuitive Eating scale, which is accessible at the Intuitive Eating website, and that has some really beautiful questions - as well as a workbook - that can be really helpful and is actually typically safe, applicable, and accessible for someone who\u2019s not under someone else\u2019s clinical care to just kind of answer on their own and use as a self-reflection.</p><br><h3>And by Intuitive Eating, I know there are a number of principles behind this practice, but in a simple sense, I think you mean the practice of not dieting, not restricting food, not focusing on weight, not seeing certain foods or eating behaviors as inherently \u201cgood\u201d or \u201cbad,\u201d and instead shifting toward eating in a way that allows one to take pleasure in eating and really listens to one\u2019s body - and honors cues of hunger and fullness - to best support what the body needs. And as you mentioned earlier, to also accept one\u2019s body as it is.</h3><br><p>And there\u2019s literature showing that shifting toward using Intuitive Eating or mindful eating tools usually helps new moms get to a comfortable place - a place their body is meant to be in terms of composition - in a safer, more sustainable way, rather than restrictive dieting.</p><br><p>Another excellent book to read that helps unpack weight stigma within a scientific context is Health At Every Size (HAES), and it's also available as an audiobook. Consider following HAES aligned therapists and nutrition professionals on social media who are passionate about making healthcare welcoming to all body sizes.</p>br><h3>Related to this, a lot of \u201cwellness\u201d culture presents itself as being all about self-improvement and empowerment and health, but really just seems to be diet-culture masquerading as something new. It seems that certain varieties of \u201cwellness\u201d can so quickly move in an extreme direction - eating only \u201cgood\u201d foods and \u201cclean\u201d foods while avoiding or restricting \u201cbad\u201d foods, rigid exercise regimens - and also contribute to increased body dissatisfaction. In your own experience, what do you see as being particularly problematic about this sort of \u201cwellness\u201d culture?</h3><br><p>I think that when we have a wellness culture that continues to pathologize body fatness and focus on changing weight instead of changing behavior to become healthier and more sustainable and kinder, that\u2019s always going to be a problem.</p><br><p>You know, I can't look at my size 10 foot and say, \u201cBe a size 6!\u201d We can accept that we can\u2019t just will our body to change when it comes to something like that. At a certain point, we cannot actually change our body size. The only thing we can change is our behavior and our attitudes towards our bodies and how we talk about body size diversity with our friends, family, and especially our kids.</p>br><p>So anytime you\u2019re feeling pressured by a friend or another party - even if it\u2019s well-intentioned - I think it\u2019s so important to develop your own filters. Sometimes, for example, even well-intentioned workplace wellness endeavors, like weight loss challenges, can actually be harmful. We know these actually increase the likelihood of weight gain later on and also significantly increase the risk of developing an eating disorder or a relapse. So filtering out harmful pressure - this even includes filtering your Instagram feed! - is so important.</p><br><h3>With all of these potentially harmful influences that might contribute to making individuals not feel good about their bodies - how else can new moms and birthing parents move in a kinder direction and toward body positivity, both during pregnancy and then postpartum?</h3><br><p>Again, Intuitive Eating is a great tool - and there is a great Intuitive Eating workbook that can be used as a tool for self-reflection.</p><br><p>And I think to find the potential root causes of why someone may struggle particularly with body image, as well as to reconnect with nourishing oneself after delivering a child, we have to go back to the care that they\u2019re receiving before then - and potentially even before conception when they might have been working on enhancing their fertility. So often there\u2019s a lot of talk about body size during that time.</p><br><p>For example, if someone is diagnosed with a condition that\u2019s often associated with living in a larger body size, like polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS), there can often be a lot of stigma there. With PCOS there may be insulin resistance or pre-diabetes, so individuals may be asked to monitor their blood pressure and blood sugar. And these things may be medically necessary, but they can potentially create hypervigilance. So if something like that is already starting to feel triggering, there are resources out there - like \u201cEat What You Love with Diabetes,\u201d a lovely book and part of the \u201cAm I Hungry?\u201d series by Dr. Michelle May, while it\u2019s not directly about PCOS, would be a helpful book to continue to have a healthy relationship with food while managing a condition that may be influenced by food.</p><br><p>And weight-stigma for those pregnant in larger bodies impacts an individual\u2019s experience as a patient during pregnancy, impacts quality of care, and may also increase the risk of feeling less supported by one\u2019s care team, so there\u2019s the risk of missing opportunities for providing more adequate care.</p><br><p>The other piece of this is if there\u2019s any history of chronic dieting, eating disorder, or struggling with body image already, and you\u2019re entering into the fertility process, or if you are pregnant, or during the perinatal period, you\u2019re going to want to develop really healthy boundaries with your providers. Decide what you\u2019re comfortable disclosing - because that is up to you - but it\u2019s really important that you decide how you want to handle what is potentially going to be a lot of triggering information.</p><br><p>So for women in larger bodies or those in recovery from an eating disorder, learning how to be your own advocate, being honest about your history, and establishing boundaries can be really meaningful. You can even recruit a partner or friends as advocates. And if this feels tough, a therapist can really help.</p></div>",

    "body": "<div class='body-nutrition'><p>So you\u2019ve survived the glucose tolerance test, and your doctor tells you that you have gestational diabetes. Now what do you do? Although it can be worrying, making changes to your diet can help you continue with a healthy pregnancy.</p><br><p>The goal for those with gestational diabetes is to maintain control of blood sugar. Your physician may recommend testing your blood glucose to decide what is the best treatment plan for you. However, all women should be counseled to follow a nutrition plan to manage blood sugar and get the nutrients they need during pregnancy. The Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics Gestational Diabetes Mellitus Guideline lays out the latest recommendations for managing GDM. Here is a summary of what they recommend.</p><br><h3>Carbohydrates</h3><br><p>There is no standard recommendation for grams of carbohydrates for women with GDM. The amount of carbohydrates you should eat will depend on your glycemic control, and your doctor or dietitian should tell you how many you should eat at meals and snacks. There is evidence that a diet limited to 45% of calories from carbohydrates may prevent hyperglycemia. And don\u2019t forget - the types of carbohydrates are also important! Carbohydrates with a low or medium glycemic index can help with blood sugar control, while refined carbohydrates and simple sugars can spike blood sugars after meals. Foods that are low on the glycemic index include whole grains, beans, nuts, fruit and milk.</p><br><h3>Meals and snacks</h3><br><p>When you eat can also affect blood sugar levels. Spreading out meals and snacks throughout the day can help moderate blood sugar levels after eating. Most people can aim for three smaller meals and two snacks per day. However, your individual needs may be different depending on your glucose control, activity levels, and nutritional needs. Eating most of your carbohydrates in the middle of the day may also help improve your blood sugars throughout the day.</p><br><h3>Protein</h3><br><p>Including a source of protein with your meals and snacks can keep you feeling satisfied, and can moderate the rise of blood sugars after meals. Protein has little effect on blood sugars, and may actually even slow the absorption of carbohydrates.</p><br><h3>Non-nutritive sweeteners</h3><br><p>Now that you\u2019re watching your carbohydrate intake, you might choose to use artificial sweeteners in your baking and beverages. Saccharin, aspartame, sucralose, or stevia are considered safe for pregnant women by the FDA. They are several hundred times sweeter than sugar, so be aware that you may not need much! Some women may prefer to avoid sweeteners entirely. If you feel this way, instead try enjoying some whole fruits or homemade whole grain desserts that satisfy your sweet tooth on a lower glycemic index.</p><br><h3>Exercise</h3><br><p>All women are encouraged to maintain a moderate level of activity while pregnant. As little as 30 minutes of walking per day can help achieve healthy weight gain and blood sugar control. Of course, it is not recommended to begin an exercise routine if you were not already active before becoming pregnant, so talk with your doctor about safe exercises for your fitness level.</p><br><h3>Nutrition counseling</h3><br><p>Scout out your local registered dietitian to customize your nutritional needs and give you practical personalized advice. Every woman and every pregnancy is different, and a dietitian can help you create a plan and set goals to stay healthy. Visit the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics website to find a dietitian near you.</p></div>",

Among all of your research you may have heard that too much vitamin A can be toxic to your growing baby, potentially causing birth defects. But before you give up your vitamins or avoid orange vegetables, let\u2019s break down what we know about vitamin A and how you can safely supplement without going overboard.</p><br><p>Vitamin A is an important nutrient in a healthy diet. It is well known that vitamin A supports healthy eyes, immune system, growth, and reproductive health. The recommended daily intake of vitamin A during pregnancy is 770 mcg RAE (which is the same as 2,500 IU from retinol or 5,000 IU from beta-carotene in supplements). The third trimester presents the highest risk of vitamin A deficiency due to how fast the fetus is growing.</p><br><p>Most mothers in the U.S. are not at risk of deficiency as long as they have a healthy diet. However, super high supplemental doses of vitamin A during pregnancy can cause birth defects to the central nervous system, face, skull, and heart. So why is there so much vitamin A in supplements and how can we be sure we are not taking too much?</p><br><p>First it is important to know that there are several types of vitamin A, and the supplement facts label will often indicate which kind they use. Most multivitamins contain vitamin A from beta-carotene, which does not pose any risk to the developing baby. However, some acne and psoriasis medications and creams containing retinoids are not recommended during pregnancy because they can lead to excess vitamin A being absorbed.</p><br><p>The types of prenatal supplements on the market today can vary greatly in their vitamin A content. To reduce the chance of taking too much, choose a prenatal multivitamin with no more than 5,000 IU of vitamin A from beta-carotene. The best and safest way to get just enough vitamin A is through eating a variety of vegetables and fruits like sweet potatoes, carrots, red peppers, spinach, broccoli, and mangoes. A well balanced diet provides you with the nutrition you need for a healthy pregnancy, while your supplement helps to fill the gaps. If you are taking retinol-containing medications be sure to talk with your doctor.</p><br></div>",

    "body": "<div class='body-nutrition'><p>Here are 10 essential nutrients that you\u2019ll want to make sure you\u2019re getting enough of while pregnant. All perform some real nutritional magic to help you and Baby grow and stay healthy in some very specific ways:</p><br><h3>Folate and folic acid</h3><br><ul><li><h3>What it does:</h3>Folate, and its synthetic form, folic acid, is a B-vitamin, and helps Baby\u2019s nervous system develop in immensely important ways. Specifically, it helps prevent neural tube defects, which are defects of the brain and spinal cord.</li><br><li><h3>Where you can find folate and folic acid:</h3>Naturally occurring folate can be found in leafy greens, beans, nuts, eggs, and citrus fruits. However, because it can be hard to meet your daily recommended levels of folate when pregnant - 400 to 800 mg - just by eating food alone, it\u2019s recommended that all expectant mothers take prenatal vitamins which contain folic acid, the synthetic form of folate.</li></ul><br><h3>Calcium</h3><br><ul><li><h3>What it does: </h3>Calcium helps to build Baby\u2019s bones and teeth as well as helps to regulate your circulatory, muscular, and nervous systems.</li><br><li><h3>Where you can find calcium:</h3>Dairy products like milk, cheese, and yogurt are by and large the best sources of calcium, but it can also be found in dark leafy greens, eggs, tofu, and fish.</li></ul><br><h3>Vitamin D</h3><br><ul><li><h3>What it does: </h3>Vitamin D partners with calcium to help Baby\u2019s bones and teeth grow good and strong, and it also helps with skin and eyesight.</li><br><li><h3>Where you can find Vitamin D:</h3>Fatty fish is a phenomenal source of Vitamin D, and it can also be found in fortified milk and juice as well as eggs. Vitamin D is also produced in the body when you\u2019re exposed to sunlight.</li></ul><br><h3>Protein</h3><br><ul><li><h3>What it does: </h3>Iron is used to make hemoglobin, a substance in red blood cells that carries oxygen throughout your body, delivering it to tissues and organs. When pregnant, you need much more iron than you did prior so that both you and Baby can get enough oxygen. If your iron levels are low, you run the risk of developing iron-deficiency anemia.</li><br><li><h3>Where you can find iron:</h3>Iron can be found in lean red meat, poultry, fish, beans, peas, dark leafy greens, and fortified cereals.</li></ul><br><h3>Vitamin C</h3><br><ul><li><h3>What it does: </h3>Vitamin C and iron actually have a very important partnership, because Vitamin C makes it easier for your body to absorb iron, especially iron that comes from plants. Vitamin C also helps build strong bones and teeth, helps build healthy blood cells and blood vessels, and helps boost immunity.</li><br><li><h3>Where you can find Vitamin C:</h3>Vitamin C can be found in a number of fruits as vegetables, such as citrus fruits, tomatoes, berries, peppers, and broccoli.</li></ul><br><h3>Iodine</h3><br><ul><li><h3>What it does: </h3>Iodine is hugely important for Baby, helping with brain and nervous system development as well as to prevent developmental, cognitive, and hearing issues. It also helps with healthy thyroid regulation.</li><br><li><h3>Where you can find iodine:</h3>Iodine can be found in fish, seaweed, dairy, poultry, eggs, potatoes, beans, as well as iodized salt.</li></ul><br><h3>DHA</h3><br><ul><li><h3>What it does: </h3>DHA is an omega-3 fatty acid that helps with Baby\u2019s brain and visual development and can help reduce your risk of health disease.</li><br><li><h3>Where you can find DHA:</h3>These good fats can be found in fatty fish - like salmon or tuna - and even in enriched or fortified eggs.</li></ul><br><h3>Zinc</h3><br><ul><li><h3>What it does: </h3>Zinc helps with Baby\u2019s cell growth and brain development, and can help boost your immune system. Zinc is also linked with a lowered risk of low birth weight and preterm delivery.</li><br><li><h3>Where you can find zinc:</h3>Zinc can be found in lean red meat, poultry, fish, pork, beans, peas, nuts, seeds, dairy, and fortified cereals.</li></ul><br><h3>Choline</h3><br><ul><li><h3>What it does: </h3>Choline helps with healthy bone development and helps to prevent high blood pressure.</li><br><li><h3>Where you can find choline:</h3>Choline can be found in lean red meat, poultry, fish, pork, eggs, and cruciferous vegetables like broccoli and cauliflower.</li></ul></div>",

Nearly 6 million children are affected by food allergies, and the prevalence of food allergy has increased by 50% between 1997 and 2011. Having a parent or sibling with allergies increases the risk of developing allergies, so if you or your partner are one of the 9 million adults that suffer from food allergies you may be wondering how you can prevent the same for your baby.</p><br><p>It is no wonder this topic has been a debate among medical professionals for years. In the past doctors would recommend avoiding the \u201cBig-8\u201d most common foods that cause allergic reactions. These are peanuts, tree nuts, milk, egg, wheat, soy, fish and shellfish. Allergy to sesame seeds also affects hundreds of thousands of Americans.</p><br><p>If you already have an allergy you are probably already taking steps to avoid a reaction. But is it necessary for pregnant women without food allergy to ditch these nutritious foods from their diet?</p><br><h3>What the research says</h3><br><p>Thankfully recent research has shown that it is not recommended to avoid any specific foods during pregnancy or lactation to avoid allergies. And interestingly, eating foods like peanuts and tree nuts during pregnancy may actually reduce the risk of developing an allergy. Not to mention that many of these foods are also part of a nutritious and well-balanced diet. For instance, fish and nuts contain healthy fats that are beneficial for babies\u2019 brain development, and foods with wheat and peanuts may also contain folate, which is can prevent neural tube defects.</p><br><p>Many studies have shown that once you have your baby you can begin to take steps to prevent food allergies for your child. The American Academy of Pediatrics and the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics recommends that infants are exclusively breastfed for the first 6 months of life without the mother restricting foods to prevent allergies. Once your baby is ready to try solids you should consider including potentially allergenic foods early on. The National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases now recommends infants begin trying peanut between 4 and 6 months old, which could potentially reduce the risk of developing a peanut allergy.</p><br><p>So don\u2019t fret about allergies just yet! Focus on a nutritious, well-balanced diet to promote your baby\u2019s healthy development and talk with your doctor or midwife about your plans for feeding your infant.</p></div>",

That is why it is important to make every bite count!</p><br><p>So if you are wondering what you should be eating, read on to learn more about the healthiest foods to fuel your pregnancy!</p><br><h3>Eggs</h3><br><p>Eggs are a powerhouse of nutrition in a tiny convenient package. One egg contains 6 grams of protein and 13 essential vitamins and minerals. This includes 125 mg of choline, which promotes brain development early in life. There was never a better reason to enjoy breakfast for dinner!</p><br><h3>Berries</h3><br><p>Blended in a smoothie, on top of pancakes, cereal, or simply as a snack, berries will give you the benefits of vitamin C, potassium, folate, and fiber. It\u2019s easy to enjoy these delicate summer fruits all year long when you buy frozen berries.</p><br><h3>Yogurt</h3><br><p>Pregnant women need 1000 mg of calcium each day to help their baby grow strong bones and prevent the risk of osteoporosis. 1 cup of plain low-fat yogurt gives you 415 mg of calcium and 12g protein3, which is more than a cup of milk! Try a yogurt parfait with berries and granola for an easy and delicious snack.</p><br><h3>Whole Grains</h3><br><p>Pregnancy is not a time for low-carb dieting! You need about 175g of carbs per day for the energy it takes to grow your baby. Choose whole grain options, like brown rice, 100% whole wheat, oats, and corn. They are also a great source of B-vitamins, such as folic acid, as well as iron and fiber to help keep you moving3.</p><br><h3>Beans</h3><br><p>Black, kidney, pinto, garbanzos, or lentils \u2013 all types of beans are a must for the pregnant woman\u2019s diet! These little wonders can be added to soups, salads, pasta, or mashed into a sandwich. Beans are an excellent source of protein, fiber, iron, folate, calcium, magnesium and zinc3.</p><br><h3>Sweet Potatoes</h3><br><p>This versatile vegetable is a good source of potassium, vitamin A, and vitamin C. You can also get 7g of fiber per cup of sweet potatoes to help you battle constipation3. For a super-fast and nutrient-dense meal, microwave a potato and top with your favorite meat or beans, tomato, avocado and cheese!</p><br><h3>Dark Leafy Greens</h3><br><p>There is a reason kale has been trendy for the past several years! Dark greens are rich in almost every vitamin a pregnant woman needs, and are an excellent source of antioxidants and phytochemicals that are important for good health. Don\u2019t limit yourself to the same old spinach salad \u2013 try arugula, collard greens, and mustard greens to to mix things up.</p><br><h3>Salmon</h3><br><p>The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists recommends 2-3 servings (8-12 ounces) of fish per week for pregnant women. This helps your baby get the omega-3 fatty acids they need for brain and neurological development. Salmon, along with haddock, sardines, and shrimp, is a lower mercury fish.</p><br><h3>Avocado</h3><br><p>Rich and buttery avocados are a delicious way to get your fill of healthy fats, folate, potassium and antioxidants. A 2016 study in Nutrients identified avocadoes as a unique source of the critical nutrients mothers need. So go beyond guacamole and enjoy avocados on sandwiches, salads, or simply spread on toast.</p><br><h3>Nuts and Seeds</h3><br><p>Looking for a healthy on-the-go snack? Nuts and seeds are a perfect choice, as they are easy to carry, can be added to almost any meal, and provide the healthy fats and protein you need in a convenient little package. Try dark-chocolate covered or chocolate dusted nuts for a sweet treat! </p></div>",

This begins early in the second trimester, when your baby is busy developing their taste buds.</p><br><p>As if there weren\u2019t enough reasons to eat well, your baby\u2019s experiences with healthy food while they are in utero may be shaping their preferences for those foods later on in life. Studies have shown that when infants are introduced to solid foods that their mothers ate while pregnant, they winced less than those infants that were not exposed to those foods in utero. So when you are eating broccoli and spinach during pregnancy, your baby can also enjoy those flavors and may be more likely to eat their veggies at the dinner table!</p><br><p>Just like you, pregnant women around the world are eating foods common to where they live. Whether you love spicy ethnic foods or prefer simply prepared meals, you are gearing your baby up to accept the culinary traditions of your family. After all, chances are high that what you are eating now will be what you feed your child in the future.</p><br><h3>Setting Baby up for nutritional success</h3><br><p>The 2015 Dietary Guidelines for Americans encourages a healthy diet full of vegetables, fruits, whole grains and lean proteins, while limiting excess salt, fat and added sugars. So if you are concerned if your child will eat their vegetables or will be a picky eater, you may want to focus on these foods while pregnant, since we know your diet can help establish preferences for healthy foods later in life. Flavor exposure also continues for babies through breast milk. So if you plan to breastfeed, your baby will also share the spicy, sweet, sour or bitter flavors you\u2019ve eaten between feedings.</p><br><p>Next time you hear someone say you are \u201ceating for two,\u201d what they might actually mean is that your baby tastes all the flavors of your food with you! So go ahead and enjoy a healthful and varied diet - for the both of you!</p></div>",

    "body": "<div class='body-nutrition'><p>With all of the dietary restrictions around pregnancy it is easy to feel confused and unsure of what you can safely eat. Luckily there are many options for you to pick from that can satisfy your cravings! Read on for six ideas of how to swap in pregnancy-safe.</p><br><p><strong>Instead of:</strong>Large fish high in mercury, like tuna, sea bass and swordfish</p><p><strong>Choose:</strong>Smaller fish that are lower in mercury, like salmon, shrimp, freshwater trout, Atlantic haddock, sardines, crab, scallops and tilapia.Even though fish is healthy, large sized fish are higher in mercury and may be harmful to a developing baby\u2019s\u2019 brain and nervous system. Smaller fish have less mercury and are a better choice. Eat 2-3 servings of low-mercury fish per week and try to eat a variety of different types.</p><br><p><strong>Instead of:</strong>Cold deli meats</p><p><strong>Choose:</strong>Cooked deli meats.Your favorite sandwich fillings like ham, turkey, roast beef and even hot dogs are more likely to carry listeria, which is a type of bacteria that can increase the risk of pregnancy loss. Pregnant women are 10 times more likely to get sick from listeria because our immune systems are weaker. So if you can\u2019t resist that turkey sandwich, cook your cold cuts in the microwave until steaming hot before eating. Add a little cheese, lettuce and tomato and you\u2019re ready to have a delicious lunch.</p><br><p><strong>Instead of:</strong>Unpasteurized soft cheese, like feta, queso fresco, Brie, Camembert, and Gorgonzola</p><p><strong>Choose instead:</strong>Any pasteurized cheese.Good news: you can feel safe in choosing soft cheeses as long as it says \u201cmade with pasteurized milk\u201d on the label. For the same reason as deli meats, raw and unpasteurized cheeses may carry listeria. However almost all cheese that is sold in major grocery stores in the United States is pasteurized. It still might be a good idea to check the label, though, and ask your waiter if the cheese is pasteurized when dining out at a restaurant.</p><br><p><strong>Instead of:</strong>Alcoholic beverages</p><p><strong>Choose:</strong>Mocktails!You may miss that glass of wine, but a fun part of not drinking alcohol is you can experiment with different types of faux cocktails! A quick Google search will result in thousands of recipes, such as Non-Alcoholic Sangria or Virgin Grapefruit Mojito. When at a restaurant, ask the bartender for their most creative non-alcoholic beverages and you might even start a trend at your table!</p><br><p><strong>Instead of:</strong>Caffeinated beverages</p><p><strong>Choose:</strong>Less caffeine.Too much caffeine during pregnancy is associated with risk of low-birth weight and can increase risk of pregnancy loss. Thankfully, we now know that drinking less than 200 mg per day can be safe, so you can feel comfortable enjoying a small coffee or \u201chalf-caff\u201d the next time you visit your local java shop. However, take note that not all caffeinated beverages are created equal. For instance, at Starbucks a Tall Dark Roast coffee has 193 mg caffeine, while a Tall Blonde Roast coffee will have 270 mg caffeine. Other favorites like tea, soda and energy drinks also have caffeine, so check the label. You can go to Caffeine Informer for the estimated caffeine content of different drinks.</p><br><p><strong>Instead of:</strong>Homemade foods made with raw eggs</p><p><strong>Choose:</strong>Store-bought sauces, dressings and dessertsYummy foods like raw cookie dough, hollandaise sauce, fresh Caesar dressing or desserts like custards and meringue pie are usually made with raw eggs. So this may be the one time where processed foods are safer for you than fresh. If you\u2019re really missing out on your favorite foods made with raw egg, you can cheat and choose commercially prepared options, such as powdered hollandaise, bottled Caesar dressing and pre-packaged custards. These have a much lower risk of carrying Salmonella!</p></div>",

    "body": "<div class='body-nutrition'><p>During your first trimester you may be glowing with happiness! Or, if you are like the 70-80% of all pregnant women who experience some form of morning sickness (or all-day sickness as many would call it) you might feel more like you\u2019re flushed than glowing.</p><p>And what about all that fatigue? Feeling tired all of the time may be one of the first signs of pregnancy for many women. Since we can\u2019t swig back shots of espresso all day, finding healthier alternatives to keep our energy up may help.</p><p>Here are a few tips to keep you feeling energized and alleviate that nagging nausea:</p><h5>Eat first thing in the morning</h5><p>Waking up with an empty stomach can enhance nausea. Try something small and easy to digest, like saltines, oyster crackers, or dry plain cereal. If you have an appetite, enjoy a light and nutritious breakfast, like plain yogurt with fruit, toast and avocado, or an egg and English muffin to give you energy to start your day.</p><h5>Eat small, frequent meals throughout the day</h5><p>Larger meals can make you feel tired, as your body is using more energy for digestion. And to prevent nausea it is best to eat a snack or light meal before you start to feel hungry. You\u2019ll be packing snacks for your baby soon, so you may as well start practicing for yourself now!</p><h5>Skip the fatty foods</h5><p>These can slow down your digestion and make you feel nauseated longer and drained of energy. Fill your plate with simply prepared foods that are mostly healthy carbs and lean protein to keep energized.</p><h5>Try foods that fight nausea</h5><p>Ginger, lemon, and peppermint help soothe an upset stomach. Cool treats carry less smells, can be easier to eat, and also ease your tummy. Stock up on teas, popsicles, sorbet, or sherbet to help you manage nausea</p><h5>Choose bland yet nutritious, whole foods</h5><p>Processed foods that are high in salt, sugar, and refined carbohydrates may make you feel even more fatigued and nauseated than before. Opt for fresh vegetables, fruits, nuts, whole grains, and lean proteins to maximize your nutrition while not making you feel bogged down.</p><h5>Stay hydrated</h5><p>If you aren\u2019t already doing so, start carrying a bottle of water with you everywhere. Dehydration can make you feel weak and tired. Begin to transition to non-caffeinated beverages or moderate your caffeine intake to less than 200 mg per day (about the same as a 12-ounce dark roast coffee).</p><h5>Take your vitamins at night</h5><p>Since vitamins may make some people feel nauseated, you may be able to tolerate them better if they take them before bed.</p><h5>Consider Vitamin B6</h5><p>B-vitamins help give you extra energy and some women find it helps reduce nausea. Talk with your OB or midwife about adding Viamin B6 to your regimen.</p><h5>Go for a brisk walk or get up and stretch</h5><p>Getting a little exercise throughout the day can help wake you up and boost your mood. A quick walk in the fresh air can help you feel better, if not all day, then least for a short while. Again, talk with your doctor before initiating any new exercise routine during pregnancy.</p></div>",

    "body": "<div class='body-nutrition'><p>The pregnancy journey evolves as you go through each trimester. At each stage, it\u2019s important to optimize nutrient intake because you share your diet with the growing fetus. With pregnancy, you\u2019ll probably experience a variety of cravings and aversions \u2013 especially early on -- so if you\u2019re unable to eat your nutrients, consult your doctor for an appropriate prenatal multivitamin.Here are 10 nutrition tips for pregnancy:</p><p><strong>Hydrate</strong>During pregnancy, water is essential not only for thirst but for placenta and amniotic sac formation. Through the placenta, your baby will receive nutrients for growth. Adequate hydration could also prevent premature labor. Drink at least 8 (8-oz) glasses of water and consume water rich fruits and vegetables consistently.</p><p><strong>Increase iron intake</strong>When pregnant, you\u2019re not losing iron as opposed to during menstruation, but you\u2019re body is making more red blood cells for the journey to provide iron-rich blood to your little one. By 20 weeks, you\u2019ll be on the last of your initial iron supply (built up since pre-pregnancy), so you\u2019ll need to continue to increase dietary iron intake.</p><p><strong>Increase fiber</strong>Your GI system gets taken for a toss during pregnancy. The best way to ensure a consistent outflow is by consuming adequate fiber on a daily basis. Starting the day with oatmeal, whole grains, flaxseed or a vegetable-rich smoothie. It\u2019s also helpful in regulating blood sugar if you\u2019re at risk for gestational diabetes.</p><p><strong>Breakfast is key</strong>It\u2019s important for you to start the day with a nutritious, wholesome meal. Find a combination of foods that work for you and focus on macronutrient (carbs, fats, protein) variety. Fueling yourself from the start is essential so that you don\u2019t let your blood sugar drop and nosh on unwanted calories (outside of cravings!).</p><p><strong>Don\u2019t stop the fatty fish</strong>If you have eaten fish prior to pregnancy, continuing during your pregnancy is recommended \u2013 specifically two 6-ounce servings of low mercury fish. The essential fatty oils are beneficial for fetal brain development.</p><p><strong>Be mindful</strong>There are days where you won\u2019t be able to say no to your cravings but on the whole, it is important to be mindful during pregnancy. Focus on variety and wholesome foods that will give you energy, provide you with nutritional support and help you stay healthy and strong throughout. Though your body will require additional caloric support eating for two is just a myth.</p><p><strong>Curb caffeine</strong>You don\u2019t have to give up coffee but be mindful about consumption. Caffeine can be dehydrating especially if you\u2019re active and/or live in warmer climates so you want to ensure adequate hydration throughout the day. Stick to one 8-ounce cup per day.</p><p><strong>Incorporate legumes</strong>Legumes are excellent plant-based sources of fiber, protein, iron, folate and calcium, all of which are important for the body during pregnancy. It\u2019s also easy to access and caters to recipe versatility. You could add beans, chickpeas, etc to a salad, blend into a spread, or make a soup/chili.</p><p><strong>Avoid eating late</strong>Because heartburn and acid reflux are relatively common during pregnancy, it\u2019s important to eat your dinner on the earlier side. It is recommended to give yourself at least 2 hours between dinner and bedtime.</p><p><strong>Seltzer water is a yay</strong>If you\u2019ve been uncomfortable with indigestion, heartburn, acid reflux or stomach related issues, try seltzer a.k.a. fizzy water. It helps dissipate the gas from your body and you may feel a relief. Though it should not be a replacement to regular water, it should be consumed in moderation and mindfully.</p></div>",

    "body": "<div class='body-nutrition'><p>It\u2019s clear that adequate protein intake is crucial during pregnancy for keeping you strong for labor, and helping your baby build a brilliant brain, muscles, and everything else. However, some people, like vegetarians, vegans, and those who simply don\u2019t love meat, may have more difficulty getting that recommended amount of protein. Thankfully, there are plenty of other excellent sources of protein for the herbivores out there</p><p><strong>Eggs</strong>Although vegans do not eat eggs because of the fact that they are an animal byproduct, eggs are a wonderful source of protein for those who do eat them. With about 6 g of protein in each egg (almost 10% of the daily recommended amount during pregnancy), eggs are among the best non-meat sources of protein, and also contain other beneficial nutrients, like Omega-3 fatty acids, that help aid proper development.</p><p><strong>Milk</strong>Another animal byproduct that vegans and some vegetarians may not drink, milk is packed with protein, containing about 8 g in each cup. Milk is also loaded with calcium to help you and your baby build strong bones, and is often fortified with Vitamin D - a necessary combo during pregnancy.</p><p><strong>Peas</strong>Who\u2019d have thought? Just one cup of peas contains about 8 g of protein, which is a huge amount of the recommended daily value. Peas are also loaded with fiber, Vitamin C, and Vitamin B6, all of which are important while you\u2019re pregnant.</p><p><strong>Quinoa</strong>Of course quinoa is on the list - this heralded \u201csupergrain\u201d contains about 8 g of protein in a cup, and it also brings plenty of other nutrients to the table. Quinoa is really hot right now, and for good reason - it\u2019s also loaded with folate and Vitamin B6 to help your baby develop more healthfully.</p><p><strong>Nuts and seeds</strong>Nuts and seeds contain tons of protein, and so long as you don\u2019t have a nut allergy, they\u2019re perfectly okay to eat given any other dietary restriction. Almonds, pumpkin seeds, and sunflower seeds are among the best choices, though just about all nuts and seeds are high in protein.</p><p><strong>Beans</strong>Though some beans, like soybeans, are higher in protein than others, beans are another group of food where you really can\u2019t go wrong. They also frequently contain fiber, which helps with your digestion.</p><p><strong>Tofu</strong>The ultimate source for any vegan or vegetarian, this soy product is absolutely brimming with protein, containing about 10 g in just a half of a cup! Tofu is also an excellent source of calcium, and iron, which is crucial for the production of healthy red blood cells for both you and your baby.</p><p><strong>Leafy greens</strong>Whether vegetarian or omnivore, leafy greens make up a part of any healthy pregnancy diet. Leafy greens contain varying amounts of protein, but some like broccoli and brussel sprouts are actually quite good sources. Leafy greens also have plenty of folate, calcium, Vitamin C, and other nutrients to help keep you and your baby as healthy as possible.</p></div>",

The cramping, especially if it comes with spotting, is probably happening because Baby is implanting herself into your uterine wall. You also might notice some white vaginal discharge as the walls of your uterus thicken. However, these symptoms are also easily confused for PMS symptoms, or vice versa.If you feel like the magic may be happening inside you, now might be the time to take a pregnancy test, as your hCG levels may be significant enough to register a positive result. If it reads negative, don\u2019t give up hope: it can take up to a week after your expected period to display those two pink lines.

Because it\u2019s making that connection, this is when anything in your bloodstream starts to get a direct line to your poppyseed-sized Baby.By now the neural tube, which sprouts to become the brain and spinal cord, is forming, and the amniotic sac and fluid, in which Baby will live for the next eight months, is present. Baby also has three \u201cgerm\u201d layers: the endoderm, which becomes her lungs and most of the vital organs; the mesoderm, which will grow into the heart and skeleton; and the ectoderm, which makes up the nervous system.", 
    "mom": "Feeling the heat yet? Not literally - if you\u2019re going to have hot flashes, chances are they won\u2019t hit for at least a few more weeks. By the fourth week of pregnancy, though, even many women who are not trying to conceive have the inkling that they are pregnant, whether due to bloating caused by the hormone progesterone, mild discomfort in the form of implanting in your uterus, or some other sensation. For most women, nausea and vomiting are still a bit down the road at this point, but the science experiment taking place inside of you is already wreaking hormonal havoc, and you may experience mood swings as a result - think of it as your first adventure in the emotional rollercoaster that is parenting!The increase in estrogen and progesterone is also doing a number to reduce the speed with which your digestive system works, in an effort to maximize nutrient absorption and most effectively supply and nurture your growing baby. You may experience aversions to certain foods as a result, but don\u2019t worry, this is perfectly normal. The scientific reasoning around food aversions during pregnancy is murky, but the two leading schools of thought surrounding aversions in early pregnancy are that either the nausea is triggered by the hCG produced by Baby\u2019s placenta, which will nourish and protect her throughout your pregnancy, or that aversions are your body\u2019s way of limiting you from eating things that will be bad for Baby\u2019s development. Whichever one is true, just remember that many side effects are nature's way of keeping both you and your baby healthy.",

Nausea and hormonal swings are the most common symptoms of pregnancy this early, though you might be starting to experience other symptoms as well.", 
    "mickey": "Baby now looks like a tiny tadpole, and is approximately the size of a black peppercorn. The neural tube has recently grown a little tail, but this will disappear back into the spinal cord long before Baby is born.Baby may already be turning into a brainiac, with most of her early development right now happening in her brain, but really, she\u2019s all heart. Baby\u2019s circulatory system is going to be ready to go soon - her heart is already starting to form its different chambers! In fact, a heartbeat may even show up on an ultrasound now.Major organs, including the stomach and liver, and bodily systems like the digestive and nervous, are beginning to develop, too. Baby is still growing like crazy, nearly doubling in size each week. With growth like that, you\u2019re lucky you don\u2019t have to buy clothes yet!",

If it has, stay calm and patient - it\u2019s no fun, but aside from the little things you can do to try to counter it, like peppermint and ginger, it\u2019s pretty much a waiting game at this point. The nausea will probably end in the next few weeks - relatively few women experience morning sickness past the first trimester.By now, you might be experiencing physical effects of the increase in production of those mischievous hormones, including sore breasts and a frequent urge to pee: these are all totally normal. If you haven't already, it's time to start implementing a healthy and baby-friendly diet, a light but active exercise regimen, and add a prenatal vitamin to your routine. It\u2019s time to remove junk food from your daily menu, and replace it with nuts (almonds are high in protein and magnesium, and so work especially well), fresh fruits, vegetables, meat and fish. Try to avoid processed foods. Remember that link between Baby\u2019s placenta and your bloodstream that formed last week? Anything that goes into your body goes into Baby's as well.

Many women in this week of their pregnancy experience morning sickness as well as exhaustion, so if you\u2019re not feeling them yet, now\u2019s a good time to clean up your diet and get plenty of water and exercise to try to head them off before they hit. If you\u2019re already feeling them, it\u2019s still a good time to make sure you\u2019re eating as healthily as you can be, hydrating, and getting some exercise, to best deal with the symptoms.", 
    "mickey": "Baby is now the size of a blueberry, measuring approximately \u00bc of an inch long. This may not seem huge, but just think about how much she has grown in the past month, from a tiny collection of cells to the increasingly complex human being-to-be who is currently in the process of sprouting all of her facial features. Her cute little nose and curious eyes are just starting to form, although they still merely look like little dark spots on oversized head. Passages and arches that will grow and develop into parts of Baby\u2019s ears and jaw are forming, and her nose won\u2019t be far behind.Development of Baby's lower body lags behind that of the upper, making her look slightly like a mermaid, and she may already be wiggling her flipper-like arms!Baby is also starting to straighten out from her formerly curled position, and that pesky tail is making its way to its final destination in her back.These upcoming weeks are the most important for Baby developmentally, so if you aren\u2019t on a prenatal vitamin yet, it is important to start immediately. During this week, Baby\u2019s neural tube is in the process of closing along her back, and the folic acid from prenatal vitamins, as well as from nutrition, that can help to prevent neural tube defects is especially important at this point. You will also probably be choosing a healthcare provider around now, as the first consultation usually happens around week eight.There are a few different types of healthcare providers you can use during pregnancy, but the most common are OB/GYNs and Certified Nurse Midwives (CNMs). Women with certain risk factors may need to see an OB, but women with no elevated risks are typically able to see CNMs as their primary healthcare provider during pregnancy, as CNMs are able to provide most of the same services that an OB might.", 
    "mom": "If you\u2019re feeling sick to your stomach right now, you aren\u2019t alone. During the sixth week of pregnancy over 80% of moms-to-be experience nausea, which usually starts in the morning (hence the term \u201cmorning sickness\u201d) before dissipating in the early afternoon. However, nausea during the first trimester is not exclusive to the mornings - that terrible feeling could hit you at any point during the day or night. To combat the symptoms of morning sickness, healthcare providers usually recommend cutting out greasy or spicy foods, drinking enough water so that you stay hydrated, and getting plenty of rest.Rest should not be a difficult thing to accomplish right now, as many women in early pregnancy are exhausted to the point where even the smallest amount of activity takes a huge toll on the body. After all, even though your body hasn\u2019t grown in size much yet, it is producing significantly more blood than it\u2019s used to in order to get nutrients to Baby, which is an energy expense that also leaves you with lower blood pressure and lower blood sugar. The added progesterone coursing around your body could also be helping to tire you out. If your body can deal with it, try going for a walk or doing yoga: the endorphins you release may make you feel better and less sluggish.Your breasts are also likely to be sore at this time, and your nipples may stick out more than normal. This tenderness will probably last through your first trimester, as your breasts continue to grow. Like the many other seemingly odd things that will happen to your body over the next seven or eight months, this is completely normal. It\u2019s simply a product of increased blood flow to your chest in order to prime yourself for breastfeeding, and your overactive hormones definitely don\u2019t help. Although spotting or vaginal bleeding is common in early pregnancy, call your healthcare provider if it happens, because it can be an early indicator of a miscarriage or an ectopic pregnancy.",

With all that activity going on in there, it\u2019s no wonder you'll probably have to start peeing more often as your growing uterus puts added pressure on your bladder.",

Some women don\u2019t, and it isn\u2019t necessarily a sign of any problem. If you are concerned though, you can mention it to your healthcare provider at your first checkup, which you\u2019ve probably scheduled for soon.If you haven\u2019t, now is the time to first decide whether you\u2019ll be going to a general practitioner, OB-GYN, or midwife for your medical care during pregnancy, and to set up an appointment. It\u2019s also a good time to talk to your partner about whether you want company for all of these appointments, or just for the big ones.One of the most common and notable symptoms of pregnancy at this stage is the increased need to pee. This is a result of both your growing uterus (now twice its normal size) putting pressure on the bladder, and the increased blood flow needed to sustain Baby\u2019s healthy development. Although symptoms like nausea generally recede by the middle of the second trimester, the increased frequency of urination is not likely to end before delivery; in fact, as Baby grows, you are only going to pee more, and more often. By now, you\u2019ll probably also notice an increase in the size of your breasts. Soreness and discomfort are almost sure to come with the bigger bust, so you may want to think about investing in a maternity bra. Food cravings or aversions are now commonplace, due to the hormones coursing through your body. They may also cause zits and extra saliva.

And if you've had a good appetite or are experiencing cravings, it could also be whatever foods you've been noshing on. Just try to keep in mind that a healthier mom leads to a healthier pregnancy, delivery, and baby. Cravings are a lot like aversions in that we don\u2019t know exactly what causes them or why, though it seems likely that it\u2019s got something to do with all the hormones coursing through your body. One theory is that cravings point out nutrients you need more of in your life, and if you\u2019re having healthy cravings, there\u2019s certainly no harm in indulging them a little. However, there\u2019s also a good chance it\u2019s not baby who\u2019s yearning for that second bar of chocolate, so don\u2019t forget that plenty of cravings probably have as much to do with your need for stress relief, or your heightened sense of smell, as they do with anything else.But if eating is a struggle right now and you're feeling rather nauseous - and for many people morning sickness is rather rough at this time - trying sucking on a ginger lollipop, or switching to a chewable prenatal vitamin. You might also consider cutting down on how much you eat at each meal, while increasing the number of times you eat throughout the day. On the other hand, if you haven\u2019t started getting morning sickness yet, there\u2019s a good chance you\u2019re not going to - lucky you!You may not start showing for a while yet, but your uterus has already started growing, and it\u2019s only going to speed up in the coming weeks, so brace yourself. Look at the way your breasts may already be growing and changing as a preview of what\u2019s coming!On the bright side, you might notice your mood swings petering out by this time, as the placenta is beginning to shoulder the hormonal load, and your own hormone production can take a bit of a break. Other totally normal and expected symptoms you may experience right now are a heightened sense of smell, and weird dreams.

Baby\u2019s heart isn\u2019t the only thing moving, either - she is starting to move around enough that it might even be visible in an ultrasound scan, which your healthcare provider may perform at your next appointment.Her digestive system is also functional by this point, transporting food matter to bowels in preparation for that first poop!

From here on out, you are probably going to start gaining weight at a more rapid rate, and you should keep track of your weight gain to make sure it is in the healthy range.As far as pregnancy symptoms go, you might notice an increase in vaginal discharge, as well as more visible veins, due to the extra blood being carried to Baby. In fact, total blood volume in the body may increase between 30 and 50% during pregnancy, and is something to watch carefully if you have a history of cardiac problems, as the increase in the blood being pumped through the heart can put it under strain. The vaginal discharge is nothing to worry about, as long as it\u2019s whitish, thin (or clear, later in your pregnancy), and odorless. Discharge that\u2019s tinged with yellow, green, or has a thick or uneven texture could be a sign of infection.Visible veins are also a natural physical reaction to the hugely increased blood volume, including both varicose veins, which usually show up as bulky blue veins on the legs, and spider veins, which are smaller clusters of visible blood vessels expanding out from a central point on your face, arms, or chest. Varicose veins can be painful, though spider veins generally aren\u2019t.

They'll move back into abdomen and eventually reach their final location in her stomach. Baby is also practicing breathing by inhaling and exhaling the amniotic fluid surrounding her, which is only strange when you think about what amniotic fluid is made up of - mostly water, Baby\u2019s skin cells, and Baby\u2019s waste (she still needs a lesson in social customs).Her kidneys are beginning to function, and she has also started building up the waste she will store until her first poop, a tarry substance known as meconium.

This is a result of the same hormones that relax your muscles to make it easier to give birth - they also relax the valve that keeps the stomach acid out of your esophagus. Your expanding uterus, which by now has grown to the size of a softball, doesn\u2019t help either. As your uterus grows, it puts pressure on your stomach that can push acid into the esophagus. The best way to fight heartburn is by providing your body with only premium fuel (that is, fresh fruits and vegetables), eating more, smaller meals, and eating them slowly, and drinking plenty of water. You should let your healthcare provider know if your heartburn is persistent.

Lanugo usually falls out a few weeks before delivery, but it\u2019s not uncommon to stay on for a little while after birth. Baby is about three inches long, the size of a jalapeno.", 
    "mom": "Congratulations, you\u2019ve reached the last week of your first trimester! Most women report the first as the most difficult trimester, so if you were one of those hit most hard by morning sickness and fatigue, you can begin to rest easier (though not too easy). One prevalent symptom of week 13 is an increased sex drive. Unless your healthcare provider recommends pelvic rest for a condition like placenta previa, sex during pregnancy is totally normal and completely healthy right up until your water breaks, so don\u2019t worry about any health complications for Baby (after your water breaks is a different story, but you\u2019ve got a little time before you have to start thinking about that). You might begin to experience more second trimester symptoms, like food cravings and aversions, swollen or tender breasts, and constipation.You\u2019ll also probably notice an increase in vaginal discharge, specifically leukorrhea, a milky discharge that protects the birth canal from infection. Unless the discharge comes with discomfort, rash, or a strong smell, this discharge is nothing to worry about. Since it\u2019s not a sign of a problem, though, there\u2019s nothing you can really do to stop it. For your comfort, you can use panty liners to keep it contained, but don\u2019t use tampons, which can introduce bacteria into your vagina. If you are in week 13, you\u2019re doing great! Keep up the healthy eating and daily exercise, and always remember to take your prenatal vitamin!",

Baby\u2019s growing like crazy, as she is about 3 \u00bd inches long, the size of a beet, and has doubled in weight since last week. Her weight is only going to start increasing even more as she begins to add fat to her her skinny little frame over the next few months. She is also producing white blood cells, which will come in handy when she needs to fight infection after birth, when your immune system will no longer be able to send strong, adult cells to help fight any infection.Her immune system took a while to come online, mostly to give your antibodies a chance to settle in before it started to do its job, so that her fledgling immune system didn\u2019t have the chance to see you as a threat. Now that your antibodies are settling in and doing their job, Baby\u2019s immune system has the chance to start to develop, under your care.",

Your belly is going to become a magnet once that growing bump gets bigger, so prepare yourself. It\u2019s never rude to deny somebody a feel. Headaches and dizziness are common symptoms of the second trimester, as is round ligament pain, which presents itself when your growing womb puts added pressure on your ligaments.You may feel this discomfort in your lower abdomen or groin. It sounds simple, but one of the best ways to deal with round ligament pain is to give yourself time to rest, and to avoid sudden movement. In the longer term, exercising to strengthen your core can also help to avoid round ligament pain. If, however, you feel intense pain in your abdomen, or if your pain doesn\u2019t go away after resting, you should call your healthcare provider. Your breasts are also going to continue to grow, but the soreness is likely to decrease, as will the constant need to pee and your fatigue. Doesn\u2019t the second trimester sound just lovely?",

You should start preparing your wardrobe to gain more weight, and you should be monitoring your weight gain to make sure it is in the healthy range. This means that at this point, you might already be starting to have some preliminary thoughts about maternity clothes. Depending on whether you need to acquire a whole new, office-appropriate look, or you have the option to deck yourself out in comfy, casual, flowy clothes, this process can either be a lot of fun, or another added stress. Either way, keep in mind that you\u2019re only going to keep growing as Baby does. Who knows? Maybe buying clothes with room to grow into will put you back in touch with your inner child right before a brand-new, outer child comes into your life.Your body is circulating more blood so you can provide Baby with all the nutrients she needs, but you\u2019ll experience certain symptoms as a result. Stuffy or bloody noses may occur during the next few months, so try to avoid too much smoke, dust, or aerosols. In fact, your respiratory system might be encountering problems from a couple of different directions. If you\u2019re prone to seasonal allergies, you may have already noticed that they can become more serious during pregnancy, though some women also notice them less - it\u2019s another one of those \u2018everyone\u2019s symptoms are different,\u2019 kind of symptoms. If you usually take an allergy medication, you\u2019ve probably already talked to your healthcare provider about what medications are safe to take during pregnancy, but if pregnancy is making your allergies worse than they usually would be, you may want to talk to your provider about it at your next appointment. Nasal sprays are generally thought to have less of a chance of impacting Baby than oral medication, but make sure that your healthcare provider approves any sprays before you use them, because some sprays run the risk of being absorbed.On the other hand, some women might be starting to notice that beautiful \u201cpregnancy glow.\u201d See?

Those first movements can feel like a large range of things, from a flutter like butterflies, to gas, to popcorn popping!The same increased bloodflow that\u2019s busy keeping circulation up in your growing, changing body, and getting you ready to breastfeed is going to keep contributing to that increased vaginal discharge, as well as nasal congestion. You might also notice constipation and the appearance of varicose veins. Your back may start to hurt soon as well, as that growing baby bump is changing your center of gravity and straining your back forward. When it develops, back pain is a symptom that is not likely to dissipate at any time during your pregnancy, as your womb is only getting bigger until you give birth. However, getting a pregnancy pillow to use for support as you sleep on your side may help relieve some of the discomfort.Now is also the time for the medical tests that can determine whether all is going smoothly with Baby. These include simple ultrasounds, multiple marker tests (MMT) of your blood, and if either of those raised any red flags, an amniocentesis, which is a highly invasive procedure that involves a low risk of miscarriage. Not every woman gets an amniocentesis, but some healthcare providers recommend them to those who of advanced maternal age or other risk factors, or those whose screening tests raised concerns. Still, every pregnancy is different, and it can be both helpful and reassuring to try to find out as much as you can about your baby\u2019s unique health and development.",

In order to deal with these pains, try lying on your left side rather than your back in order to most reduce the amount of pressure that your uterus doles out to its surroundings. You may want to pick up a maternity belt in order to help support your belly, and baby. Bodily fluids like vaginal discharge, sweat, and mucous are also probably flowing more than normal, as a result of the increased blood circulation in your body. Your appetite is going to pick up soon as well, because a growing baby needs more and more nutrition each day to keep development on course.You might also start experiencing weird dreams, probably due to your most likely disrupted sleep schedule. While pregnancy hormones and the fact that you\u2019re going through a major change in your life may play a part in the fact that you could be experiencing strange or vivid dreams, it could also be the case that you're just remembering your dreams more vividly than before. If you\u2019re waking up a few times every night for a bathroom run, aches and pains, or just straight up insomnia, you have a better chance of remembering the dreams you were having before each time you wake up than you do of remembering dreams from the middle of the night when you sleep until morning.

Lower blood pressure during pregnancy happens fairly regularly, because your circulatory expands a lot to meet the massive increase in bloodflow pregnancy brings, but sometimes that increase in bloodflow is on a slightly different timeline and needs a little time to catch up.

These changes in pigment happen because of all of the extra estrogen and progesterone in your system, and will fade after delivery when your hormone levels start to return to normal. When these dark patches appear on your face, they are termed \u201cchloasma\u201d. Although they will fade after delivery and they are very unlikely to be problematic, they can be bothersome. If you\u2019d like to minimize them, take care to apply sunscreen to your skin, because if you are exposed to the sun\u2019s ultraviolet rays, it can intensify the pigment discoloration. This discoloration can show up in other places, like darkening scars, and will probably darken your nipples. The nipple darkening is probably to make it easier for Baby\u2019s brand new eyes to zero in for early breastfeeding, but the other changes are probably side-effects rather than evolutionary tactics.You might also be experiencing hip pain. If this is the case for you, trying sticking a pillow between your knees and sleeping on your side- this could alleviate some of the pressure. Your rapid weight gain may cause stretch marks on your belly and legs. You may wish to use a fragrance-free moisturizer, but the best way to combat stretch marks is through prevention, which in this case is maintaining an active lifestyle and workout regimen throughout your pregnancy that promotes skin elasticity as your body continues to grow with Baby\u2019s. If you need an added incentive besides Baby\u2019s health to exercise, helping to prevent your own stretch marks can be the cherry on top of your pile of reasons.Read more",

On the other hand, though, some babies are still a little shy at this point, and may wriggle or positions themselves in a way that can make it hard for the ultrasound technician to tell their sex.Baby is still practicing breathing by inhaling amniotic fluid, and is starting to produce meconium, the sticky black substance that will make up her first poop.

You might start to notice a hardening of your nails and a thickening of your hair at this time. Some of that hair might start sprouting out of places where you normally do not see hair grow, like your chin. Don\u2019t freak out if this happens to you, as it is very common, and generally goes back to normal before too long after delivery, although some women do report permanent changes in hair texture after pregnancy.As Baby continues to grow, you might start to have more trouble sleeping, or finding a comfortable position to sleep in. Don\u2019t be afraid to fidget or toss and turn, until you find a sleep position that\u2019s comfortable. You also may not be precisely \u2018eating for two\u2019 but you\u2019re definitely moving two bodies around with you every day, which makes getting your rest extra important.

Your increased bloodflow reaches everywhere, after all, even your mouth, which can lead to sore and swollen gums, and leave you more vulnerable than usual to infection. It can also lead to sore or bleeding gums when you brush or floss. The best way to deal with this is to brush regularly with a soft-bristled brush - there\u2019s nothing wrong with being a little gentle with your gums when they hurt. Be sure to rinse your mouth out with clean water if you vomit, and brush your teeth not long after. It\u2019s also a good idea to have at least one dentist\u2019s appointment during pregnancy, as long as you\u2019re sure your dentist knows that you\u2019re pregnant, and how far along you are.

Baby is now about a foot tall (30.5 cm), and weighs close to a pound (450 g). Her eyes are still developing, as she still lacks pigment in her iris, and therefore an eye color. Baby is now the size of an ear of corn.", 
    "mom": "Those without a detailed knowledge of pregnancy and the symptoms that come with it may be surprised to find out that many of the side effects, particularly in the second trimester, have nothing to do with your womb, but other places in your body, like hair, nails, and mouth. Your feet and hands may be the next unusual places to feel pregnancy\u2019s effects, as they will swell up during these months. Wearing maternity compression stockings may help improve your circulation and reduce swelling, in addition to helping with varicose veins. Your rings might start feeling tighter, and your foot could grow a whole size bigger.Beyond that, your heartburn might still be lingering, too, and to return to your expanding womb, it may have made your \u201cinnie\u201d into an \u201coutie\u201d by now. Don\u2019t worry, it\u2019ll go back to normal after you give birth. Your newly out-facing belly button might be a little sensitive, especially as it rubs against your clothes, but that\u2019s generally nothing to worry about. If, on the other hand, it\u2019s causing you pain, talk to your healthcare provider to make sure it\u2019s not an umbilical hernia. Even if there\u2019s nothing wrong, it never hurts to know exactly what is going on inside your body, because you\u2019re going to want to do whatever you can to keep your precious cargo safe.",

Gestational diabetes and preeclampsia are pregnancy conditions that may pose a serious threat to your health, and could develop around this time, so while it\u2019s probably already scheduled with your healthcare provider, it\u2019s important to make sure you are being monitored for these.",

Baby\u2019s face is fully formed, and is simply waiting on the fat to fill it out. By now you know that Baby is starting to kick like crazy, usually in response to noises she hears from the outside world. Baby is also constructing the blood vessels in her lungs that will allow her to breathe air on her own once she is born. Baby is a bit over a foot tall (30.5 cm), the size of a bunch of grapes, and weighs almost 20 ounces, or 1 \u00bc lbs (570 g).", 
    "mom": "Those feet might be swelling soon, and they will be worse at the end of a tough day, or if the summer heat is baking you. Although swelling is expected, excessive swelling could be a symptom of preeclampsia, a condition characterized by high blood pressure and an influx of protein in your urine. See a healthcare provider if your swelling seems out of the ordinary. You might also start experiencing a tingling in the hands caused by carpal tunnel. Carpal tunnel developed during pregnancy usually goes away after delivery, so your healthcare provider may not do much to treat it, although in some cases, he or she may use splints, or recommend that you limit certain activities. If you do end up feeling that pain, tingling, or numbness in your fingers, hands, or wrists, it\u2019s another thing you can blame on all those hormones overloading your system. A buildup of fluid can also make you more susceptible.Other symptoms that might start popping up include forgetfulness and excessive snoring, though that one will probably bother your partner more than it bothers you. Braxton-Hicks contractions might also start setting in soon. They usually aren't particularly painful, and are just a natural consequence of your uterus preparing itself to give birth.Your healthcare provider will probably test you for gestational diabetes in one of your next few appointments. Gestational diabetes isn't usually apparent before the test, so it\u2019s important to get tested at the appropriate time. Preeclampsia, on the other hand, can be signaled by headaches, changes in your vision, pain in your upper abdomen, excessive nausea, or changes in urine, so if you experience any of these symptoms, check in with your healthcare provider.",

And according to a 2011 study, this could impact her food preferences later in life, so make sure to eat your vegetables - it might mean you'll have an easier time convincing your toddler to do the same in a few years.Baby\u2019s lungs are developing significantly now from all of her practice breathing, and she is making cells that will produce surfactant, a material that will help her lungs expand and operate once she reaches the air. Surfactant exists to help keep the lungs from sticking together when they expand. Baby\u2019s surfactant production will probably speed up a bit around week 30, and by week 32, she will probably have produced enough not to need any extra from your healthcare provider when she is born.She also gained about a quarter of a pound last week (110 g) in bones, muscle, and fat, so she is finally beginning to fill out into a real baby-shape. And even though Baby\u2019s eyebrows, lashes, and hair are coming in, they still lack pigment and appear white. Her skin is beginning to glow a bit pinker, due to the appearance of capillaries. Her ears and fingernails are also complete by now. By the end of this week, Baby is probably about 13 inches long (33 cm), the size of an eggplant, and weighs about 1.5 lbs (680 g).",

Topical creams exist that could help reduce the itchiness, as can avoiding baths and showers that are too hot, which can dry out your skin, and using unscented, mild lotions and soaps. Your ankles and fingers might be swollen as well, due in part to fluid retention, and the pressure of your growing uterus on your veins. For relief, try elevating your feet or icing the swollen areas to help alleviate some of the pain. Constipation, headaches, and vision changes or dry eyes may also prove to be issues.

    "mom": "As you approach the third trimester, it\u2019s time for the more unsavory symptoms of pregnancy to begin to manifest, including gas, constipation, and hemorrhoids. Over half of pregnant women experience hemorrhoids because of their uterus pressing down on veins in the rectum. Kegels and maintaining regularity may help to prevent them. Gas is common, and harder to control than it normally would be, as pregnancy tends to slow down your gastrointestinal tract because of all the extra progesterone in your system. Gas could also be getting worse now in particular because the size your uterus has grown to is putting some pressure on your abdominal cavity. Gas is inevitable for many women, but paying attention to your diet could help - avoid fried foods, carbonated drinks, and any food you notice is a particular trigger for you. You should also take care to hydrate, and to eat slowly and chew thoroughly.Your hormones are messing around again, which could leave your whole body aching. These aches can be hard to avoid entirely, with all of the changes your body is going through, but there are ways to limit them. Like a lot of things about pregnancy, a lot of the same rules apply from the things you should be doing all the time, like exercising, and loading up on fruits and vegetables. It\u2019s also time to start bending with your knees instead of leaning over at your waist when you lean down to pick things up, because even simple motions like this can put a lot of extra strain on your back with the special extra passenger you\u2019ve brought on board. Try to relax as much as you can - take warm baths, and see if you can\u2019t get your partner to give you a massage. A calm and relaxed pregnancy is the best way to deliver a healthy baby!",

Baby\u2019s vision is yet another reason to make sure you\u2019re gaining weight at the rate your healthcare professional suggests, as low birth weight has been linked with infant vision problems.She is also gearing up her immune system for birth by borrowing some of your antibodies. One theory about the development of Baby\u2019s immune system is that because of this \u2018share and share alike\u2019 attitude, her immune system after birth will be the best suited to the environments you\u2019re adapted to. This means that she could be adapted to live best in your home. Most of Baby\u2019s bodily systems and functions are now intact, and most of the rest of her development purely revolves around putting on height and weight.

If this affects you, try cutting down on caffeine or taking iron supplements, as these can both reduce the aggravation caused by RLS. You may also want to try using compression stockings.

As your delivery day grows closer, they may begin to mimic true labor more, but this \u2018false labor\u2019 is different from actual labor in that it doesn\u2019t progress the way true labor does, often has irregular contractions, and can change or end if you shift your position.

It\u2019s the 21st century, and we now know that moms-to-be can maintain a level of activity right up until they give birth, but staying active when carrying around all the extra weight and space becomes more and more difficult. Swimming, or other aquatic exercise, can be a good way to stay active while also momentarily taking some of the pressure off of your body. Yoga can help you avoid back pain, while aerobic exercises and light weight lifting can help boost both your mood and your strength for the major workout you\u2019re going to be putting your body through in delivery. Pregnancy-specific exercise classes can also be a great way to connect with other soon-to-be-moms! Try to stay as active as you can without overextending yourself.It\u2019s time to get started on some of the more physical, practical details of getting your home and life ready for Baby, like purchasing a crib, car seat, and other baby-related items, as well as adjusting any insurance policies as you see fit in order to best protect your family. Getting Baby\u2019s nursery set up, and figuring out how to install the car seat that you\u2019ll bring her home in from the hospital can be a great way to get your partner more directly involved in preparation for Baby\u2019s arrival, but some of the ins and outs of constructing those important Baby-must-haves can also be hard and frustrating (think Ikea instructions and then some). Don\u2019t forget to leave yourselves plenty of time, and to be patient with yourselves and each other, especially if you\u2019ve never done this before. Nobody is born knowing how to be a parent - there\u2019s always a learning curve!Your skin, hair, and nails could be getting brittle at this point - stronger, thicker hair and nails are the pregnancy symptoms that get the most press, mostly because they\u2019re more fun, but between all the not-so-new-anymore hormones in your body and the extra demand for nutrients the growing Baby in your body calls for, plenty of women experience the opposite. This is totally normal, and just like the thicker, stronger hair and nails, it doesn\u2019t last forever. Your hair and nails should return to just about where they started by a few months after you give birth. In the meantime, you can combat some of the changes to your nails by keeping your hands well moisturized, and wearing gloves when you\u2019re doing dishes.You could also still be experiencing dizziness, flatulence, and nasal congestion. There\u2019s a chance you might also develop Symphysis pubis dysfunction (SPD), a disorder caused by the pregnancy hormone relaxin that makes your pelvic joint particularly unstable, and in need of support. SPD won\u2019t hurt Baby, but it could definitely make your life a lot harder. There are treatments available to help limit the impact it has on you, so if you start to experience pain around your pubic bone, lower back, or perineum that you think could be SPD, check in with your healthcare provider about possible treatments.",

Many women find that a little education goes a long way in helping them feel as prepared as possible for such a new undertaking, so you may want to seek out and sign up for a breastfeeding class to learn about all of the ins and outs of nursing. You should also speak with your healthcare provider about your choice, ask them any questions you have, and see if they can recommend any breastfeeding classes in your area. In addition, your provider can check to see if you have flat or inverted nipples, which can make it harder for Baby to latch on. And to round out all of your breastfeeding preparedness, it's also a good time to figure out what kind of breast pump, if any, you\u2019re going to use.Baby\u2019s wrinkles are starting to disappear as she packs on an increasing amount of fat, which will aid her in regulating her body temperature. Temperature regulation, like the surfactant she is producing to help her lungs expand, is a big step for Baby towards being able to thrive outside the womb.

Your healthcare provider may also give you a Rhogam shot if your blood came back Rh-negative. Your Braxton-Hicks contractions will continue, as might the shortness of breath and the difficulty sleeping. Of course, side effects differ between all women, so you may still be feeling sluggish when most women\u2019s libidos are cranking. It\u2019s all perfectly normal. Every pregnancy, every baby, and every mom are different from one another.Even though you\u2019ve probably been thinking about your baby\u2019s name forever, now might be a good time to start if you have not, or to start narrowing it down if you\u2019ve got a few strong candidates. Many new moms like to keep the name they choose private between themselves and their partners until their babies are legally and officially named, so that they won\u2019t have to field any well-meaning attempts to change their minds, but if you do want a little outside input into your naming choice, now is a good time to poll your family and friends.

Try to eat a lot of fiber in order to deal with constipation, as constipation might also lead to pesky hemorrhoids. The third trimester can also really mess with your head, in the form of headaches and forgetfulness. Again, the best way to deal with this is mostly to give yourself as much rest as you can manage, and trying to avoid headaches triggered by tension or dehydration before they start. If frequent or intense headaches are making it difficult to complete your daily routine, talk to your healthcare provider about safe ways to treat them during pregnancy.

At this point, most babies will start to move from the breech position to the safer, easier birth position where their heads are delivered first. If your healthcare provider says Baby doesn\u2019t appear to be moving from the breech position, you can ask them about exercises to encourage Baby into the birth position.

She might be close to 17 \u00bd inches (44.5 cm) tall, the size of a head of lettuce, and weighs over 3 \u00bd lbs (1.6 kg), though could still grow 3-5 more lbs. (1.35-2.25 kg) in the coming weeks.", 
    "mom": "Feeling out of breath? Baby is getting so big now that she is really crowding your lungs, possibly making it difficult for you to breathe. If this difficulty is persistent or accompanied by chest pain, you should mention it to your doctor. If your body is a little bit of an overachiever, you may notice a bit of yellowish discharge that is thicker than milk leaking from your breasts. This means they\u2019ve already started to produce colostrum. Colostrum is designed to be Baby\u2019 first super-food, packed with antibodies to provide her with all kinds of crucial nutrients and antibodies that can help give her immune system a massive boost. If you want to protect your shirts for the next few weeks, consider investing in some breast pads to soak the colostrum up.You\u2019ll also keep feeling those Braxton-Hicks contractions, which might last about 30 seconds. Although these random contractions are highly normal, particularly in the third trimester, if you have more than four contractions in an hour, this could be a sign of premature labor, so call your doctor right away. Other indicators of early labor are a bloodier vaginal discharge, lower back pain, and increased pressure in your pelvis. As you approach the delivery date, you should start preparing by keeping a bag packed with clothes, and everything else you may need for a slightly extended stay at the hospital. This is also a good time to see if the hospital or birthing center where you plan to deliver requires or allows pre-registration. Pre-registration can help you cut out the time spent filling out paperwork when you\u2019re in labor. Keep readying yourself for the big day - she will be here sooner than you think.",

Her head has a full coating of fuzz, and her skin is filling out as she packs on the pounds. She is still a little ways away from her first mani-pedi, but she does have a full set of both fingernails and toenails already. In fact, one of her favorite activities right now is sucking her thumb, which actually improves coordination and familiarizes her with her body. You\u2019re a bit of time away from when Baby sucking her thumb could be a problem - at this point, it\u2019s probably actually a sign of healthy development.Baby is really practicing for the big stage, breathing and \u201cswimming\u201d like crazy. She is also probably already in the head down position to prepare for delivery.

You\u2019ve probably reached a peak in that increased bloodflow by now that\u2019s been contributing to any number of symptoms, so those symptoms are probably still present. Just remember, that extra 50% of blood in your body is currently helping to keep Baby snug and safe, and is going to help make up for the blood you lose in delivery. Probably the most common symptom of third trimester pregnancy is the increased need to pee, so never go too far from a bathroom! The hemorrhoids, flatulence, and constipation might continue as well. It\u2019s also time to start thinking about what you want to do for pain management during delivery. You\u2019ll have plenty of time to discuss your options with your healthcare provider, as you\u2019ve reached the point where even the healthiest pregnant women\u2019s appointments increase to once every two weeks. Epidural anesthesia is among the most common pain management options, though many women also opt for other medications, or elect to have medication-free births entirely.It\u2019s also important to prepare for after delivery - you want to be as prepared as you can be for Baby\u2019s arrival, including \u201cbaby-proofing\u201d the house to keep it as safe and welcoming as possible for the day when you finally get to bring her home. Baby may not be up and moving on her own right away, but she will reach that point sooner than you know it, and you'll be glad to have dealt with any potential hazards before then.",

As for sex, it\u2019s as true now as it was a few weeks ago, even as your delivery date rushes closer - you may have to make some odd adjustments, but sex is completely normal and healthy right up until labor.

At this point in pregnancy though, there is a large variation between babies' sizes, and it\u2019s harder to give an estimate for how big Baby is getting. She\u2019s going to keep putting on that half pound (230 g) a week until a couple of weeks before she is born, though, and as long as your healthcare provider says she\u2019s on track, it\u2019s safe to assume that Baby is doing fine.She is beginning to keep her eyes open while she is awake, so she can see all of the lovely sights of the uterus! Counting kicks is as important as ever, and can do a great deal to monitor her health. It's a good idea to take some time aside everyday to count the kicks. Baby\u2019s bones are still forming, and relatively soft, but they keep hardening, and her brain is developing further and further every day. She\u2019s almost ready to be born!",

If you\u2019re still feeling frisky, feel free to keep up a healthy sexual relationship with your partner - it won\u2019t inhibit Baby\u2019s development - in fact, Baby probably won\u2019t notice, even now when she is growing all big and observant. Most women also experience insomnia during their third trimester, between restless minds, restless hormones, and the difficulty of finding a comfortable position to sleep in.

Her lungs, brain, and central nervous system keep rapidly developing, and all but the lungs are reaching their final stage of development in the womb.

While these symptoms are normal - and uncomfortable - side effects of pregnancy, make sure to tell your healthcare provider if you notice your vision changing, or if your ankles or feet swell suddenly - these could be signs of preeclampsia. Try to get as much rest as possible, to deal with some of the symptoms, and keep as healthy as possible. Your hormones are preparing the pelvis for delivery, so you might notice increased vaginal discharge and you\u2019ll definitely have to pee more. Your expanding pelvis could also cause an increase in lower back pain at this point. As annoying as these symptoms are, just remember that everything happening to you is just your body\u2019s way of keeping you and Baby as healthy as possible until delivery day.It\u2019s also time to make sure your hospital trip and return home are planned out. Even if you know the way to the hospital, it doesn\u2019t hurt to review, so that you\u2019re sure you (and your partner!) know the way there backwards, blindfolded, from alternate directions, and in your sleep - after all, you never know when Baby is going to decide to make an appearance!

Her digestive system is the only major system in her body that is not fully developed yet - although Baby has had plenty of practice swallowing, she will not be fully digesting food until she starts eating on the outside. Speaking of which, you should start thinking about how baby is going to get food once she is born, whether by breastfeeding or bottle. Breastfeeding is an excellent way to make sure baby stays healthy, and to bond with her, but it's not the only way to do things. Bottle feeding can give you and Baby just as much of a chance to bond, and to provide her with the nutrition she needs.At this point, if Baby is still in the breech position, or any other awkward way of hanging out in your uterus, your healthcare provider may talk to you about ways to try to get her into a more convenient position for safe labor. Baby is probably close to 19 inches (48.3 cm), and 6 lbs (2.7 kg). at this time, the size of a papaya, although variation between the height and weight of different babies increases as they get closer to birth, just like how you are bigger or smaller than people you know.", 
    "mom": "Because Baby is moving down to your pelvis as she gets ready to be born, the pressure on your lungs is probably lightening up, making breathing easy and breezy once again. This is called \u201clightening,\u201d and is often considered one of the first signs of labor, though if it\u2019s your first pregnancy it could happen weeks before you go into labor. Baby didn\u2019t just disappear though, so you will probably notice increased pelvic discomfort, pressure on your bladder, and insomnia. Your heartburn and swollen feet are also more likely than not still issues. And speaking of feet, if yours have grown significantly during pregnancy, they could stay around that size.As you approach delivery day, make sure you know the symptoms of labor so you will not get stuck in a tricky situation. Diarrhea, increased contractions, and especially your water breaking are signs that you might be going into labor. When your \u201cwater\u201d breaks, it\u2019s really the amniotic fluid, and it can be a little tough to tell if it\u2019s the real thing when it happens, as it can seem like you just peed yourself a bit (which you might have some experience with by now). Make sure you talk to your healthcare provider about what water breaking will really be like, so that you can recognize it when it comes. Some of the major differences between amniotic fluid and urine are color (amniotic fluid is lighter, ranging from clear to a very pale, straw color) and odor (the smell of amniotic fluid can range from odorless to a faintly sweet or almond-like smell).

Your healthcare provider will check in on your cervix at your next appointment, and where it is in terms of thinning will give him or her a better idea of when you\u2019ll go into labor. You won\u2019t be able to feel your cervix thinning, which can be a nice change after all of the changes pregnancy puts your body through that you can feel all too well.

That\u2019s why so many babies are born with blue eyes - blue is the color that shows up with the least melanin, and babies don\u2019t start with as much melanin as they end up with. Baby could also have up to an inch of hair, though similar to eye color, the hue of the hair could change after Baby is born.Baby could now be almost 7 pounds (3.2 kg) by now, and over 19 \u00bd (49.5 cm) inches tall - about the size of a spaghetti squash - although genetics, the amount of time spent in the womb, the health of the pregnancy, and her sex make these estimated sizes nothing more than educated guesses. Boys are generally born larger than girls, though girls will catch up in height and weight early in childhood. Baby keeps producing more and more surfactant, the substance that causes the air sacs in lungs to inflate once she is breathing in oxygen.

If you plan on enrolling Baby in childcare, even if the end of your maternity leave feels like it\u2019s a lifetime away, and you\u2019ll have plenty of time, it\u2019s a good idea to look into when the childcare centers you prefer have enrollment.

    "mom": "By now if you haven\u2019t delivered, you might feel like you\u2019d sell your left leg for Baby to just move out. If you don\u2019t deliver by the end of this week, your healthcare provider might talk to you about inducing labor, but most healthcare providers won\u2019t suggest induction unless it looks like longer gestation could lead to complications of infection for you or Baby.Besides a medically induced labor, though, there are a couple things you can do that may speed up the process, though most of them have not yet been scientifically proven to have an effect. Staying active, stimulating your nipples, and engaging in sexual intercourse are some popular ways to try and induce labor from the comfort of your own home. Nipple stimulation in particular is known to be effective, but some experts caution against it because it can cause uterine cramping that, in some extreme cases, could have the potential to cause fetal distress, especially at earlier points in pregnancy, before Baby was full-term.If your back is still in pain, rest easy, because pretty soon you\u2019re going to have a LOT less weight on your shoulders (and your womb!). You\u2019ll keep experiencing contractions until you give birth, and your cervix will continue to dilate and thin out, so keep track of the measurements to track the progress of your pregnancy. The day you\u2019ve waited so long for is almost here. Congratulations, you did it!",

    "intro": "Even though you just can't wait to head to the delivery room and bring Baby home, some babies seem to really like the womb better than others! The vast majority of babies aren't born on their due dates, which is a pretty rough estimate even assuming that Baby does follow a textbook timeline of development, and let\u2019s face it - textbook timelines don\u2019t often turn up in real life. It\u2019s much more likely that Baby is working on her own schedule, so it's entirely normal that she is taking a bit longer to leave her cozy apartment. Nobody is entirely sure what event triggers natural labor, but you've made it this far, and you can expect to go into labor anytime now!", 
    "mickey": "By now, Baby is alllllll ready to be born - it's just a matter of time! Unless staying in your womb for a bit longer poses a health risk to either of you, there's absolutely nothing wrong with waiting until labor starts naturally. Most of her gestational development is done (though there's still plenty to go in terms of the immune system, digestion, and skull development), so now, she is basically just packing on weight.If Baby doesn\u2019t arrive by the end of this week, there is a good chance your healthcare provider will start to talk to you seriously about inducing labor. Babies born after that point tend to be larger and harder to deliver, which can increase the risk of complications for both you and her, and makes the need for a C-section more likely, among other concerns.", 
    "mom": "Playing the waiting game, in all likelihood! Third trimester symptoms like constipation, swelling and fatigue (though some third trimester moms get a burst of energy!) may still be running rampant, but going for a walk may help to manage some of these symptoms by keeping your blood flowing and getting your energy up! In fact, going for a nice, long walk may actually also help induce labor if you're looking for any tricks to coax Baby out a little sooner.If you\u2019re looking for ways to speed things along, and you're comfortable enough with it, having sex may also help induce labor naturally - an unproven theory suggests that it\u2019s possible that your orgasm could help trigger contractions, and that the direct contact between semen and your cervix could help soften and efface it to prepare your body for labor. Scientific evidence doesn\u2019t prove that having sex brings labor around any faster, but as long as your water hasn\u2019t broken, it\u2019s definitely not going to hurt, anyway. If you do think your water may have broken though, check in with your healthcare provider before having penetrative sex, as penetration can introduce infection. One way or another though, you\u2019re going to have Baby in your arms before you know it, so rest assured, she's got to come out sometime soon!",

    "intro": "Oftentimes when babies are past their due date, it's due to a timing miscalculation rather than a not-ready baby, especially if it\u2019s been calculated based on the date of your last period, as the time of ovulation varies from cycle to cycle. However, it's also totally normal for a baby to stay in the womb for a bit longer than average - all pregnancies are as different as the babies they produce, after all!", 
    "mickey": "Baby is pretty much just packing on the babyfat at this point, as the bulk of crucial gestational development is already taken care of. Healthcare providers might perform a non-stress test at this point to check her heart rate during your contractions to make sure everything is going smoothly. By now, more tests are probably the last thing you want, but your healthcare provider is just being thorough - even pregnancies that have been totally healthy up until this point can run into some trouble when Baby stays stubbornly snuggled up in your uterus this long.Even if Baby is totally healthy in there, at this point, there\u2019s a good chance she is going to come out with some dry, maybe peeling skin, because she has stayed in there even after her protective layer of vernix has fallen away. Even though Baby has been a bit reluctant to leave the apartment, chances are it will happen by the end of this week, as about 98% of babies are born before a 43rd week of gestation.", 
    "mom": "Come on Baby! Waiting for Baby can be tough, particularly when you're past your due date, but going for a long walk or having sex are both believed to help naturally induce labor, so as long as you're comfortable, you might want to give it a shot! Just keep in mind that while most theories on how to induce labor are harmless, you\u2019re still carrying Baby and her vulnerable little system around in your body, so any method that involves taking a lot of a certain substance, or anything that pings your mom-sense as potentially dangerous, don\u2019t hesitate to check in with your healthcare provider before you try it out. You're probably still dealing with third trimester symptoms as you wait patiently for Baby to come out - just remember, it'll happen soon!",
